## Level 0 Illusion Spells (Cantrips)

### 1. Ghost Sound
- **School:** Illusion [Figment]
- **Level:** 0
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of wool or a small lump of wax)
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
- **Target/Area of Effect:** Illusory sounds in a 10-ft.-radius spread

- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when casting it and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character. The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per caster level (maximum 20 humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound spell produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from 16 humans, while a roaring dragon is equal to the noise from 20 humans.

Items dropped or put down by an invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Light, however, never becomes invisible, although a source of light can become so (thus, the effect is that of a light with no visible source).

- **Duration:** 1 min./level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** You
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** This spell creates a number of illusory doubles of you that inhabit your square. These doubles make it difficult for enemies to precisely locate and attack you. When you cast mirror image, 1d4 images plus one image per three caster levels (maximum eight images total) are created. These images remain in your space and move with you, mimicking your movements, sounds, and actions exactly. Whenever you are attacked or are the target of a spell that requires an attack roll, there is a possibility that the attack targets one of your images instead. If the attack is a hit, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. If it is a figment, the figment is destroyed. If the attack misses by 5 or less, one of your figments is destroyed by the near miss. Area spells affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells and effects that do not require an attack roll affect you normally and do not destroy any of your figments. Spells that require a touch attack are harmlessly discharged if used to destroy a figment.

You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is 100% certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is "sprung"; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time.

### 7. Phantasmal Assailants

- **Level:** 2

If that save fails, the phantasmal assailants touch the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 2d6 points of Strength damage and be staggered for 1 round. If the subject succeeds at either save, it is shaken for 1 round.

Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character. Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a powerful illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a suggestion implanted in the script by you at the time of casting.

Any affected creature moving out of the area becomes visible, but creatures moving into the area after the spell is cast do not become invisible. Affected creatures (other than the recipient) who attack negate the invisibility only for themselves. If the spell recipient attacks, the greater invisibility sphere continues to function.

A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle.

- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** This spell creates the illusion of a wall, floor, ceiling, or similar surface. It appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear.

- **Description:** You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most dreadful beast. Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or take 3d6 points of damage and be stunned for 1 round. If the subject succeeds at either save, it still takes 1d6 points of damage and is shaken for 1d4 rounds.

- **Description:** This spell functions like illusory wall, except that it creates a larger and more convincing illusion. The wall appears absolutely real when viewed, but physical objects can pass through it without difficulty. When the spell is used to hide pits, traps, or normal doors, any detection abilities that do not require sight work normally. Touch or a probing search reveals the true nature of the surface, though such measures do not cause the illusion to disappear. Additionally, the wall can appear to have a magical aura if detect magic is cast.

### 4. Phantasmal Killer
- **School:** Illusion [Phantasm] [Fear] [Mind-Affecting] [Death]
- **Level:** 4
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One living creature
- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief, then Fortitude partial; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most dreadful beast. Only the spell's subject can see the phantasmal killer. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a Will save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a Fortitude save or die from fear. Even if the Fortitude save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.

### 5. Rainbow Pattern
- **School:** Illusion [Pattern] [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** 4
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of phosphor), F (a crystal prism)
- **Duration:** Concentration + 1 round/level (D)
- **Target/Area of Effect:** Colorful lights with a 20-ft.-radius spread
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** A glowing, rainbow-hued pattern of interweaving colors fascinates those within it. Rainbow pattern fascinates a maximum of 24 HD of creatures. Creatures with the fewest HD are affected first. Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Fascinated creatures follow the moving rainbow of light, trying to get or remain within the effect. Treat them as subjects of a suggestion spell to "follow the lights." Entranced creatures can be led up to 30 feet per round. The effect ends for a specific creature when the rainbow pattern leads that creature more than 30 feet away from the point at which it first saw the pattern. Sightless creatures are not affected by rainbow pattern.

### 6. Shadow Conjuration
- **School:** Illusion [Shadow]
- **Level:** 4
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** See text
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** See text
- **Target/Area of Effect:** See text
- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with); varies; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes; see text
- **Description:** You use material from the Plane of Shadow to shape quasi-real illusions of one or more creatures, objects, or forces. Shadow conjuration can mimic any sorcerer or wizard conjuration (summoning) or conjuration (creation) spell of 3rd level or lower. Shadow conjurations are only one-fifth (20%) as strong as the real things, though creatures who believe the shadow conjurations to be real are affected by them at full strength. Any creature that interacts with the conjured object, force, or creature can make a Will save to recognize its true nature.

### 7. Phantasmal Terrain
- **School:** Illusion [Phantasm] [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** 4
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One 30-ft. cube/level (S)
- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** This spell functions like hallucinatory terrain, except that it targets creatures directly rather than creating a general illusion. Each affected creature perceives the terrain as something different, based on its own fears or desires. Unlike hallucinatory terrain, phantasmal terrain can make terrain appear more dangerous than it actually is, potentially causing creatures to take actions that result in real harm (such as stepping off what appears to be solid ground into what is actually a chasm). This spell draws inspiration from the mind-affecting illusions of Elder Scrolls and the phantasmal abilities of EverQuest illusionists.

### 8. Invisibility, Mass
- **School:** Illusion [Glamer]
- **Level:** 4
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
- **Components:** V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
- **Target/Area of Effect:** Any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 180 ft. apart
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
- **Description:** This spell functions like invisibility, except that the effect is mobile with the group and is broken when anyone in the group attacks. Individuals in the group cannot see each other. The spell is broken for any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group. If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 180 feet.

- **Target/Area of Effect:** Area touched, up to 30-ft. square/level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** Any divination (scrying) spell used to view anything within the area of this spell instead receives a false image (as the major image spell), as defined by you at the time of casting.

- **Target/Area of Effect:** One 20-ft. cube/level (S)
- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** This spell functions like hallucinatory terrain, except that it enables you to make any area appear to be something other than it is. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements. Unlike hallucinatory terrain, the spell can alter the appearance of structures (or add them where none are present). Still, it can't disguise, conceal, or add creatures (though creatures within the area might hide themselves within the illusion just as they can hide themselves within a real location).

### 3. Nightmare
- **School:** Illusion [Phantasm] [Mind-Affecting] [Evil]
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Unlimited
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One living creature
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You send a hideous and unsettling phantasmal vision to a specific creature that you name or otherwise specifically designate. The nightmare prevents restful sleep and causes 1d10 points of damage. The nightmare leaves the subject fatigued and unable to regain arcane spells for the next 24 hours. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature.

### 4. Persistent Image
- **School:** Illusion [Figment]
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
- **Components:** V, S, F (a bit of fleece and several grains of sand)
- **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)

- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
- **Spell Resistance:** No

### 5. Seeming
- **School:** Illusion [Glamer]
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 12 hours (D)
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One creature per two levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates or Will disbelief (if interacted with)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes or No; see text

### 6. Shadow Evocation
- **School:** Illusion [Shadow]
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** See text
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** See text
- **Target/Area of Effect:** See text
- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th level or lower. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless the affected creature succeeds on a Will save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a shadow evocation, a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save that would normally be allowed against the spell being simulated. For all purposes, a shadow evocation is treated as any other spell of its level, including casting time, range, area, effect, duration, and other special effects except as noted above.

### 7. Phantasmal Web
- **School:** Illusion [Phantasm] [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration + 1 round/level (D)
- **Target/Area of Effect:** 20-ft.-radius spread
- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief, then Reflex partial; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You create a phantasmal web of energy that exists only in the minds of the affected creatures. Each creature in the area must make a Will save to disbelieve the illusion. Creatures that fail their saves perceive themselves as being trapped in a web similar to that created by the web spell. They become entangled and must make a Reflex save or be unable to move. Even with a successful Reflex save, movement is at half speed, and they cannot run or charge. Each round, an affected creature can attempt a new Will save to disbelieve the phantasmal web as a full-round action. This spell draws inspiration from the mind-affecting illusions of Elder Scrolls and the phantasmal abilities of EverQuest illusionists.

### 8. Mislead
- **School:** Illusion [Figment, Glamer]
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

- **Target/Area of Effect:** You/one illusory double
- **Saving Throw:** None or Will disbelief (if interacted with); see text
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** You become invisible (as greater invisibility, a glamer), and at the same time, an illusory double of you (a figment) appears. The double appears within range but thereafter moves as you direct it (which requires concentration). You can make the figment appear superimposed perfectly over your own body so that observers don't notice an image appearing and you turning invisible. You and the figment can then move in different directions. The double moves at your speed and can talk and gesture as if it were real, but it cannot attack or cast spells, though it can pretend to do so.

The double cannot actually cast spells or affect the environment, but it can appear to do so. The double has an AC of 10 + your size modifier + your Dexterity modifier. It has your hit points and saves, and it disappears if reduced to 0 hit points.

### 2. Permanent Image

- **Level:** 6

### 3. Programmed Image
- **School:** Illusion [Figment]
- **Level:** 6
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** This spell functions like silent image, except that this spell's figment activates when a specific condition occurs. The figment includes visual, auditory, olfactory, and thermal elements, including intelligible speech. You set the triggering condition (which may be a special word) when casting the spell. The event that triggers the illusion can be as general or as specific and detailed as desired but must be based on an audible, tactile, olfactory, or visual trigger. The trigger cannot be based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. (See magic mouth for more details about such triggers.)

### 4. Shadow Walk
- **School:** Illusion [Shadow]
- **Level:** 6
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

- **Target/Area of Effect:** Up to one creature touched/level
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** To use the shadow walk spell, you must be in an area of dim light. You and any creature you touch are then transported along a coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it borders the Plane of Shadow. The effect is largely illusory, but the path is quasi-real. You can take more than one creature along with you (subject to your level limit), but all must be touching each other. In the region of shadow, you move at a rate of 50 miles per hour, moving normally on the borders of the Plane of Shadow but much more rapidly relative to the Material Plane. Thus, you can use this spell to travel rapidly by stepping onto the Plane of Shadow, moving the desired distance, and then stepping back onto the Material Plane.

### 5. Veil
- **School:** Illusion [Glamer]
- **Level:** 6
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

- **Description:** You instantly change the appearance of the subjects and then maintain that appearance for the spell's duration. You can make the subjects appear to be anything you wish. The subjects look, feel, and smell just like the creatures the spell makes them resemble. Affected creatures resume their normal appearances if slain. You must succeed on a Disguise check to duplicate the appearance of a specific individual. This spell gives you a +10 bonus on the check. Unwilling targets can negate the spell's effect on them by making Will saves or with spell resistance. Those who interact with the subjects can attempt Will disbelief saves to see through the glamer, but spell resistance doesn't help.

- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

- **Target/Area of Effect:** One living creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You create a phantasmal effect that causes the target to perceive its surroundings as wildly distorted. The target's vision, hearing, and sense of direction become completely unreliable. The target takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls, Perception checks, and all Dexterity-based skill checks. Additionally, the target must make a Will save at the beginning of its turn each round or become confused for that round. This spell draws inspiration from the mind-affecting illusions of Elder Scrolls and the phantasmal abilities of EverQuest illusionists.

### 8. Project Image
- **School:** Illusion [Shadow]
- **Level:** 6
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small replica of you worth 5 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One shadow duplicate
- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** You create a shadow duplicate of yourself that can move independently of you. The duplicate appears to be your exact duplicate, but it is formed of shadowstuff. The duplicate can move and act as you direct it, within the limits of the spell's range. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were standing where it is, and during your turn you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again, as a free action. While you are using its senses, your body is considered blinded and deafened. The duplicate is an illusion, not a conjuration, and cannot extend beyond the spell's range. If the duplicate is ever outside the spell's range, the spell ends immediately. The duplicate cannot attack or cast spells, but it can pretend to do so. It makes noise and produces smell as appropriate to its form (these are actual sounds and smells, not additional illusions). The duplicate can interact with the environment as if it had a Strength score of 2. It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force. The duplicate can't carry objects weighing more than 20 pounds.

The simulacrum looks, feels, and sounds like the original, but it has only half of the real creature's levels or HD (and the appropriate hit points, feats, skill ranks, and special abilities for a creature of that level or HD). You can't create a simulacrum of a creature whose HD or levels exceed twice your caster level. A simulacrum has no ability to become more powerful. It cannot increase its level or abilities.

Even with a successful save, the target takes half damage and is shaken for 1 round. If the target fails three consecutive saves, it becomes frightened for the remainder of the spell's duration.

- **School:** Illusion [Pattern] [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

- **Components:** V, S, M (a crystal prism)
- **Duration:** Concentration + 2 rounds
- **Target/Area of Effect:** Colorful lights in a 20-ft.-radius spread
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** A twisting pattern of discordant, coruscating colors weaves through the air, affecting creatures within it. The spell affects a total number of HD of creatures equal to your caster level (maximum 20). Creatures with the lowest HD are affected first; and, among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. The spell affects each subject according to its HD. 6 or less: Unconscious for 1d4 rounds, then stunned for 1d4 rounds, and then confused for 1d4 rounds. (Treat an unconscious result as stunned for nonliving creatures.) 7 to 12: Stunned for 1d4 rounds, then confused for 1d4 rounds. 13 or more: Confused for 1d4 rounds.

### 2. Screen
- **School:** Illusion [Glamer]
- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

- **Duration:** 24 hours
- **Target/Area of Effect:** 30-ft. cube/level (S)
- **Saving Throw:** None or Will disbelief (if interacted with); see text
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** This spell combines several elements to create a powerful protection from scrying and direct observation. When casting the spell, you dictate what will and will not be observed in the spell's area. The illusion created must be stated in general terms. Once the conditions are set, they cannot be changed. Attempts to scry the area automatically detect the image stated by you with no save allowed. Sight and sound are appropriate to the illusion created. Direct observation may allow a save (as per a normal illusion), if there is cause to disbelieve what is seen. Even entering the area does not cancel the illusion or necessarily allow a save, assuming that hidden beings take care to stay out of the way of those affected by the illusion.

### 3. Shadow Evocation, Supreme

- **Target/Area of Effect:** 30-ft.-radius spread

- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You transform the area into a nightmarish landscape visible only to the affected creatures. Each creature in the area must make a Will save or believe it is trapped in a hellish landscape filled with its worst fears. Affected creatures are considered blinded and deafened to the real world, responding only to the phantasmal hell they perceive. Each round, affected creatures take 2d6 points of damage and must make a new Will save or become panicked for 1d4 rounds. Even with a successful save, creatures take 1d6 points of damage and are shaken for 1 round. This spell draws inspiration from the master-level Illusion magic of Elder Scrolls and the high-level illusionist abilities from EverQuest.

- **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (if interacted with)
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** You create an illusion so powerful that it becomes partially real. The illusory object you create functions as if it were real for the duration of the spell. The object cannot deal damage or affect creatures directly, but it can serve as a tool, provide cover, support weight, and perform any other function that a real object of its apparent nature could perform. The object has hardness 10 and 5 hit points per caster level. If the object takes damage exceeding its hit points, it disappears. This spell draws inspiration from the reality-bending illusions of Elder Scrolls and the phantasmal abilities of EverQuest illusionists.

The new memories can be as detailed or as vague as you wish. The target fully believes that these new memories are its own and acts accordingly. Only a wish or miracle spell can restore the creature's true memories, though a successful dispel magic allows the target a new saving throw to break free of the effect.

The illusion cannot directly damage creatures, but it can indirectly cause harm (for example, by creating a bridge over a chasm that later disappears). Anyone who disbelieves the illusion sees it as transparent images superimposed on the real environment and is unaffected by any of its properties. This spell draws inspiration from the reality-bending illusions of Elder Scrolls and the phantasmal abilities of EverQuest illusionists.

The landscape appears darker, more twisted, and foreboding. All creatures in the area when the spell is cast must make a Will save or become shaken. The area counts as a manifest zone to the Plane of Shadow, allowing shadow spells to function at +2 caster level. Additionally, you can use shadow walk at will while within the area. Finally, you can spend a standard action to teleport from one point to another within the shadow landscape, as dimension door. This spell draws inspiration from the shadow magic of Elder Scrolls and the planar manipulation abilities of EverQuest.

Each round, affected creatures take 10d6 points of damage and must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. Even with a successful Fortitude save, creatures take half damage. This spell draws inspiration from the master-level Illusion magic of Elder Scrolls and the high-level illusionist abilities from EverQuest.

These objects function exactly as their real counterparts would, including providing appropriate bonuses or penalties. The illusion can create food that provides actual nourishment, water that quenches thirst, and other objects that serve their normal functions. The illusion cannot create living creatures or magic items with specific powers, though it can create items that appear magical. Anyone who disbelieves the illusion sees it as transparent images superimposed on the real environment and is unaffected by any of its properties. This spell represents the pinnacle of illusion magic, approaching the divine ability to create reality that is possessed by demigods.

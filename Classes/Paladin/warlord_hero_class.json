  "lore": "Warlords represent the perfect balance between divine power and military strategy among Oathkeepers, focusing their talents on leadership and battlefield dominance. Unlike their more zealous or corrupted counterparts, Warlords view their divine connection primarily as a tool to maintain order and stability in a chaotic world. They are pragmatic commanders who understand that sometimes difficult decisions must be made for the greater good, and that perfect justice must occasionally yield to practical necessity. Warlords often rise to prominence during times of conflict, their tactical brilliance and inspiring presence making them natural leaders of armies and military orders. They establish chains of command that function with machine-like efficiency, and their battlefield strategies are studied for generations. While they maintain their sacred oaths and divine connections, Warlords focus these powers toward practical military applications rather than purely ideological or spiritual ends. They are respected and sometimes feared for their unwavering resolve and willingness to do whatever is necessary to achieve victory, though they typically maintain a strict code of honor that prevents them from descending into true tyranny."

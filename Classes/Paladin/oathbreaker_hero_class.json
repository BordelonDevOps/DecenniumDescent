  "lore": "Oathbreakers represent the darkest path an Oathkeeper can take, having betrayed their sacred vows and corrupted their divine connection for selfish or malevolent purposes. The very power that once made them champions of light and justice now fuels their capacity for corruption and domination. The transformation into an Oathbreaker is not merely a fall from grace but a deliberate inversion of everything the paladin once stood for, twisting their divine abilities into dark reflections of their former selves. Their healing touch becomes a corrupting grasp, their holy smite transforms into necrotic destruction, and their protective auras warp into fields of despair and weakness. Oathbreakers are feared throughout the world, not only for their formidable combat abilities but for their capacity to corrupt and desecrate that which others hold sacred. Many become leaders of dark cults or unholy armies, while others operate alone, spreading corruption wherever they go. Some seek to corrupt other paladins, finding particular satisfaction in turning the righteous to darkness. The path of the Oathbreaker offers tremendous power, but at the cost of being reviled by former allies and hunted by those who still uphold the oaths they have abandoned."

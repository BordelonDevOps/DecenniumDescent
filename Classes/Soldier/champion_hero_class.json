  "lore": "Champions represent the pinnacle of heroic leadership among Commanders, having dedicated themselves to the highest ideals of honor, justice, and self-sacrifice. These paragons of virtue have transcended ordinary leadership to become living symbols of hope and courage, inspiring allies through personal example and unwavering dedication to protecting the innocent. The path to becoming a Champion requires not only exceptional combat skills and leadership abilities but also a genuine commitment to upholding moral principles even in the most challenging circumstances. Those who succeed find themselves blessed with abilities that seem to transcend mortal limitations, especially when fighting to protect others or oppose evil. Champions often serve as the moral compass of military organizations, ensuring that power is used responsibly and in service to justice rather than personal gain. Many become legendary figures whose deeds are celebrated in song and story, inspiring future generations to follow their example. Some dedicate themselves to protecting vulnerable communities from threats, while others lead crusades against powerful evil entities that threaten the world. Their presence on the battlefield can turn the tide of seemingly hopeless situations, not just through their own considerable combat prowess but through their ability to bring out the best in those who fight alongside them. Though they possess tremendous power, Champions use their abilities with humility and restraint, understanding that true heroism lies not in personal glory but in service to others and unwavering dedication to justice."

  "lore": "Tyrants represent the darkest path a Commander can take, having embraced the use of fear, intimidation, and cruelty as their primary tools of leadership. These masters of psychological domination have transcended ordinary military authority to become living embodiments of terror, capable of breaking the will of enemies and forcing absolute obedience from followers through the sheer force of their presence. The path to becoming a Tyrant requires not only exceptional combat skills and leadership abilities but also a willingness to use any means necessary to achieve dominance, regardless of moral considerations or human cost. Those who succeed find themselves capable of controlling others through fear alone, building empires on the broken wills of those they have conquered. Tyrants typically rule through carefully balanced systems of punishment and reward, ensuring that their subordinates fear failure more than death itself while offering just enough incentive to maintain loyalty. Many establish their own territories or military forces, ruling with iron fists and crushing any sign of resistance with overwhelming brutality. Others serve as enforcers or special operatives for larger organizations, deployed when absolute compliance is required or when examples need to be made. Their presence on the battlefield is often enough to break enemy morale before combat even begins, as their reputations for cruelty and the fate of those who oppose them spread far and wide. Though they may lack the moral authority of Champions or the tactical subtlety of Warlords, the psychological dominance and brutal efficiency of Tyrants make them perhaps the most feared military leaders in existence."

  "lore": "Warlords represent the pinnacle of tactical excellence among Commanders, having dedicated themselves to the mastery of warfare in all its forms. These battlefield geniuses have transcended ordinary military leadership to become living embodiments of strategic perfection, capable of analyzing complex battlefield conditions in moments and implementing flawless battle plans that consistently lead to victory. The path to becoming a Warlord requires not only exceptional combat skills and leadership abilities but also a brilliant tactical mind and unwavering focus on efficiency and results. Those who succeed find themselves capable of controlling the flow of battle with unprecedented precision, turning even the most chaotic conflicts into carefully orchestrated demonstrations of military superiority. Warlords typically maintain a pragmatic approach to warfare, valuing victory and the preservation of their forces above ideological concerns. Many serve as high-ranking military commanders, using their exceptional tactical abilities to secure victories that would be impossible for less gifted leaders. Others become independent military contractors, offering their services to the highest bidder or pursuing their own conquests. Some even establish their own territories or mercenary companies, building reputations that make potential enemies think twice before opposing them. Their presence on the battlefield is often enough to demoralize enemy forces, who recognize that they face not just a powerful warrior but a master tactician who has likely already planned their defeat in detail. Though they may lack the moral certainty of Champions or the brutal intimidation of Tyrants, the cold efficiency and tactical brilliance of Warlords make them perhaps the most consistently successful military leaders."

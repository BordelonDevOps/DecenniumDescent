  "lore": "Artificers represent the most benevolent path a Mechanist can take, having dedicated their technological genius to creating devices and constructs that heal, protect, and enhance the capabilities of others. These compassionate innovators have transcended ordinary supportive technology to develop sophisticated systems that can dramatically improve the lives of those around them, from healing critical injuries to providing protection from otherwise deadly threats. The path to becoming an Artificer requires not only exceptional technical knowledge and construct design skills but also a genuine desire to help others and a deep understanding of the needs of those they seek to assist. Those who succeed find themselves capable of creating technological marvels that can save lives, protect the innocent, and empower allies to overcome seemingly impossible challenges. Artificers typically serve as support specialists in adventuring parties or as valued members of communities where their healing and protective technologies benefit many. Many establish workshops where they develop increasingly advanced supportive systems and train apprentices to carry on their benevolent work. Some even create mobile laboratories or clinics that travel to areas in need, bringing their technological assistance to those who would otherwise lack access to such advanced help. Their combination of healing technology, protective systems, and enhancement devices makes them invaluable allies in dangerous situations, where their inventions can mean the difference between life and death. Though they may lack the offensive capabilities of more combat-focused classes, the supportive power and versatility of Artificers make them essential team members whose contributions often determine the success of challenging endeavors."

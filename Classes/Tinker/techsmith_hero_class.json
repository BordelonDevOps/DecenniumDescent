  "lore": "Techsmiths represent the pinnacle of technological innovation among Mechanists, having dedicated themselves to pushing the boundaries of what's possible through engineering excellence and revolutionary design. These brilliant innovators have transcended conventional technological limitations to develop systems and constructs of unprecedented sophistication and efficiency, constantly striving to perfect their creations and discover new technological frontiers. The path to becoming a Techsmith requires not only exceptional technical knowledge and mechanical aptitude but also a relentless drive for improvement and a mind capable of envisioning possibilities beyond current paradigms. Those who succeed find themselves capable of creating technological marvels that others would consider impossible or magical, solving complex problems through innovations that fundamentally change what technology can accomplish. Techsmiths typically operate as independent researchers or as part of advanced technological institutes, where they can focus on pushing boundaries without the constraints of immediate practical applications. Many establish specialized workshops filled with experimental devices and prototypes, constantly iterating and improving their designs in pursuit of technological perfection. Some even create technological enclaves where like-minded innovators can collaborate on breakthrough projects that might take decades to fully realize. Their combination of theoretical insight, practical engineering skill, and innovative thinking makes them unparalleled problem-solvers, capable of developing technological solutions to challenges that would stymie conventional approaches. Though they may lack the moral certainty of Artificers or the destructive focus of Warmachines, the technological brilliance and adaptive innovation of Techsmiths make them perhaps the most versatile and forward-thinking of all technological specialists."

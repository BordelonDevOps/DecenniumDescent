  "lore": "Warmachines represent the most destructive path a Mechanist can take, having dedicated their technological genius to creating weapons and combat systems of unprecedented devastation. These masters of technological warfare have transcended conventional military technology to develop weapons and constructs capable of overwhelming enemies through sheer destructive power and tactical superiority. The path to becoming a Warmachine requires not only exceptional technical knowledge and construct design skills but also a ruthless pragmatism and willingness to prioritize effectiveness over ethical considerations. Those who succeed find themselves capable of creating technological terrors that can devastate battlefields and crush opposition through superior firepower and tactical coordination. Warmachines typically serve as military specialists or independent warlords, offering their destructive capabilities to those who can afford their services or pursuing their own conquests. Many establish fortified workshops where they continuously develop increasingly devastating weapons and combat constructs, creating arsenals capable of challenging entire armies. Some even create mechanized legions under their direct control, becoming one-person military forces that few dare to oppose. Their combination of weapons engineering, combat construct command, and technological intimidation makes them feared opponents on any battlefield, where their advanced technology can quickly turn the tide of conflict. Though they may lack the supportive capabilities of Artificers or the pure innovation of Techsmiths, the destructive power and tactical dominance of Warmachines make them perhaps the most immediately impactful of all technological specialists when victory through force is the primary objective."

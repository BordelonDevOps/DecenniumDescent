  "lore": "Outriders represent the most feared and ruthless path a Pathfinder can take, becoming merciless enforcers who use their unparalleled wilderness skills to control territory and hunt down those who oppose them. These territorial predators have twisted their connection to nature into a tool for domination, establishing domains where they rule through fear and superior mobility. The path to becoming an Outrider requires not just exceptional skill in tracking and survival, but also a willingness to use terror as a weapon and a desire for control that borders on obsession. Outriders often serve as enforcers for powerful factions or warlords, patrolling borderlands and hunting down enemies with relentless efficiency. Some establish their own territories in lawless frontiers, ruling through fear and brutal examples made of those who challenge their authority. Their reputation for unstoppable pursuit makes them particularly effective at capturing fugitives or eliminating rivals, as those marked by an Outrider know that escape is virtually impossible. Though they possess tremendous power, Outriders are ultimately driven by a desire for control—over territory, over others, and over their own destiny—making them dangerous allies and terrifying enemies."

  "lore": "Warders represent the pinnacle of harmony between humanity and the natural world, having transcended the ordinary bonds between ranger and nature to become true guardians of wilderness. These extraordinary pathfinders have developed a profound spiritual connection with the natural world, allowing them to sense disturbances in the balance from great distances and channel nature's power to protect and restore. The path to becoming a Warder requires not only exceptional skill in tracking and survival but also a compassionate heart and unwavering dedication to protecting the natural world from exploitation and corruption. Warders often establish protected territories around sacred natural sites, ancient groves, or endangered ecosystems, using their powers to shield these areas from harm. Many develop deep relationships with the spirits of nature, calling upon ancient guardians when threats arise that they cannot handle alone. Though they possess tremendous power, Warders use their abilities with restraint and wisdom, understanding that their role is to maintain the delicate balance between civilization and wilderness, not to reject human progress entirely. They often serve as mediators between human settlements and the wild, teaching sustainable practices and ensuring that expansion does not come at the cost of irreparable damage to natural systems."

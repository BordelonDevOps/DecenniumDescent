  "lore": "Iron Fist Masters represent the pinnacle of martial prowess among monks. Through decades of rigorous training and discipline, they have transformed their bodies into perfect weapons, capable of feats that seem impossible to ordinary mortals. Their strikes can shatter stone, their bodies can withstand tremendous punishment, and their speed and agility defy the laws of physics. Iron Fist Masters are often found running martial arts schools, participating in tournaments, or wandering the world in search of worthy opponents to test their skills against. While they typically maintain a neutral stance in the conflicts of the world, preferring to focus on their own personal mastery, they will not hesitate to use their abilities to maintain balance when necessary."

They have corrupted their spiritual energy, tainting it with darkness and void power to enhance their deadly techniques. Way of Shadow practitioners are feared throughout the world as unstoppable assassins who can strike from nowhere and disappear without a trace. They often work as elite killers for criminal organizations or evil regimes, though some operate independently, pursuing their own dark agendas. Their mastery of stealth, combined with their lethal martial techniques, makes them some of the most dangerous individuals in existence, capable of eliminating almost any target regardless of protection."

  "lore": "BlackGuards represent the darkest path a Rake can take, having embraced forbidden powers and ruthless methods to become masters of fear and corruption. These terrifying operatives have transcended ordinary intimidation to develop supernatural abilities that allow them to break the strongest wills and corrupt the purest hearts through a combination of psychological torture and dark magic. The path to becoming a BlackGuard requires not only exceptional stealth and combat skills but also a willingness to form pacts with dark entities and embrace cruelty as a fundamental tool. Those who succeed find themselves capable of inspiring paralyzing fear in even the bravest opponents, controlling others through a perfect understanding of psychological vulnerabilities enhanced by supernatural dread. BlackGuards typically operate as enforcers, interrogators, or assassins for powerful evil organizations, using their unique abilities to maintain control through fear and eliminate those who cannot be controlled. Many establish personal networks of broken individuals who serve out of terror rather than loyalty, creating efficient operations built on fear and intimidation. Some even form their own cults or criminal organizations, using their abilities to establish themselves as nightmarish figures that few dare to oppose. Their combination of stealth, psychological manipulation, and dark powers makes them particularly effective at breaking resistance movements, extracting information, and eliminating troublesome individuals in ways that serve as warnings to others. Though they possess tremendous power, BlackGuards are often bound by the terms of their dark pacts, serving greater evils in exchange for their abilities and potentially sacrificing their own humanity in the pursuit of power and control."

  "lore": "Shadowblades represent the pinnacle of stealth and precision among Rakes, having developed an unprecedented connection to shadows and darkness that allows them to move unseen and strike with lethal efficiency. These master assassins have transcended ordinary stealth techniques to develop an almost supernatural relationship with shadows, using them not just as concealment but as weapons, tools, and means of transportation. The path to becoming a Shadowblade requires not only exceptional stealth and combat skills but also a pragmatic mindset and the discipline to maintain professional detachment regardless of the mission. Those who succeed find themselves capable of seemingly impossible feats of infiltration and assassination, moving through heavily guarded locations like ghosts and eliminating targets without leaving a trace. Shadowblades typically operate as independent contractors, offering their specialized services to clients who can afford their considerable fees. Many establish reputations for absolute reliability and discretion, becoming the go-to operatives for high-risk, high-reward contracts that require perfect execution. Some specialize in specific types of targets or operations, developing unique techniques that make them unparalleled in their niche. Their combination of shadow manipulation, mobility, and lethal precision makes them feared by even the most well-protected individuals, who know that conventional security measures offer little protection against an experienced Shadowblade. Though they possess tremendous power, Shadowblades approach their profession with pragmatic detachment, viewing their abilities as tools of their trade rather than means for personal vendettas or political agendas. This professional neutrality allows them to work for various clients across the moral spectrum, though individual Shadowblades may establish personal codes regarding what contracts they will accept."

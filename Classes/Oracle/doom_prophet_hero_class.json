  "lore": "Doom Prophets represent the darkest path a Fateweaver can take, using their mastery over destiny to orchestrate suffering and catastrophe on a massive scale. These sinister oracles have twisted their gift of foresight into a weapon, using their knowledge of possible futures to ensure the worst outcomes come to pass. They rule through fear, making terrible predictions that inevitably come true and offering protection from doom only to those who serve them. Some Doom Prophets seek to bring about the apocalypse itself, believing that the current world must be destroyed to make way for a new reality shaped by their vision. Others simply revel in the power that comes from controlling the fates of others, addicted to the fear they harvest from their victims. Their prophecies are delivered with theatrical flair designed to maximize terror, often accompanied by signs and portents that reinforce their supernatural authority. Kingdoms have fallen at the mere arrival of a Doom Prophet at their gates, as rulers surrender rather than face the meticulously detailed horrors that have been foretold. Those few who dare to defy these dark oracles often find themselves bound to particularly cruel fates, serving as examples of the futility of resistance against one who controls destiny itself."

  "lore": "Cosmic Seers represent the path of perfect neutrality among Fateweavers, transcending personal desires and moral judgments to observe the grand tapestry of fate with complete detachment. These enigmatic oracles have expanded their consciousness beyond normal limitations, perceiving the underlying patterns that govern all of reality. Unlike their good or evil counterparts, Cosmic Seers rarely intervene directly in events, preferring to maintain the delicate balance of the universe rather than push it toward any particular outcome. When they do act, it is usually to correct extreme imbalances that threaten the cosmic order itself. Their vast knowledge makes them invaluable advisors, though many find their counsel frustratingly neutral, as they present all possible futures without advocating for any particular path. Cosmic Seers often establish themselves in remote locations where they can observe the flow of destiny without distraction, though some travel the world as wandering sages, appearing at critical moments to ensure that fate unfolds as it should. They are both revered and feared for their seemingly limitless knowledge and their unwavering commitment to cosmic balance above all else."

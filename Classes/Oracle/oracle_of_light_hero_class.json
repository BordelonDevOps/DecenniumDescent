They perceive the tapestry of fate not as a tool for personal gain, but as a sacred responsibility to shepherd the world toward its brightest possible future. These luminous seers use their visions to prevent disasters, heal the wounded, and guide the lost toward their true purpose. Their prophecies inspire hope rather than fear, and their manipulations of fate always aim to maximize happiness and minimize suffering. Oracles of Light often establish sanctuaries where those in need can seek guidance, or they may travel the world in search of those whose destinies require intervention. Though they possess the power to dramatically alter the course of history, they use this ability with great restraint, understanding that even well-intentioned interference can have unforeseen consequences. They are revered throughout the world as beacons of hope in dark times, their mere presence often enough to turn the tide against despair."

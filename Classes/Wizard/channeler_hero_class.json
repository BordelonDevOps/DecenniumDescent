  "lore": "Channelers represent the most benevolent path an Evoker can take, having dedicated their magical prowess to healing, protection, and the restoration of natural harmony. These compassionate spellcasters have transcended ordinary evocation to become conduits for positive magical energies, capable of miraculous healing and the creation of powerful protective sanctuaries. The path to becoming a Channeler requires not only exceptional magical talent and energy control but also a genuine desire to help others and a deep connection to the natural world. Those who succeed find themselves capable of channeling healing energies of such potency they can restore even the most grievous injuries and purify corrupted magical environments. Channelers typically serve as healers in communities, protectors of natural sites, or members of organizations dedicated to maintaining magical balance. Many establish sanctuaries where their healing powers can benefit those in need, or travel to areas suffering from magical disruption to restore natural harmony. Some even become legendary figures whose mere presence is said to promote healing and growth in blighted areas. Their combination of powerful healing magic, protective abilities, and harmonizing influence makes them invaluable allies in conflicts against forces that corrupt or destroy, where their presence can sustain allies and neutralize harmful magical effects. Though they may lack the raw destructive power of more offense-focused spellcasters, the healing prowess and protective capabilities of Channelers make them perhaps the most valuable companions when facing threats that cause widespread harm or corruption."

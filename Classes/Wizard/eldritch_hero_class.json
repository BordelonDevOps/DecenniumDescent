  "lore": "Eldritch practitioners represent the most intellectually ambitious path an Evoker can take, having dedicated their magical prowess to understanding and manipulating the fundamental structure of reality itself. These boundary-pushing spellcasters have transcended ordinary evocation to become masters of dimensional manipulation and reality alteration, capable of magical feats that defy conventional understanding. The path to becoming an Eldritch requires not only exceptional magical talent and energy control but also a mind capable of comprehending concepts beyond normal human understanding and the discipline to maintain balance when working with volatile cosmic forces. Those who succeed find themselves capable of perceiving and manipulating reality in ways that seem impossible to ordinary spellcasters, their magic operating on principles that transcend conventional magical theory. Eldritch practitioners typically serve as dimensional guardians, reality architects, or researchers of cosmic mysteries. Many establish observatories or laboratories in locations where the boundaries between dimensions are thin, studying the nature of reality and developing new techniques for its manipulation. Some even become legendary figures whose understanding of cosmic forces allows them to resolve magical catastrophes that would overwhelm conventional spellcasters. Their combination of reality manipulation, dimensional mastery, and cosmic understanding makes them invaluable allies in conflicts involving dimensional threats or reality disruption, where their ability to perceive and manipulate the underlying structure of existence can overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Though they may lack the raw healing power of Channelers or the minion control of Necromancers, the reality-bending capabilities and dimensional mastery of Eldritch practitioners make them perhaps the most versatile problem-solvers when conventional magical approaches prove insufficient."

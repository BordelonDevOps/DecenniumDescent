  "lore": "Necromancers represent the darkest path an Evoker can take, having dedicated their magical prowess to mastering the energies of death and undeath. These morbid spellcasters have transcended ordinary evocation to become masters of life force manipulation and undead creation, capable of raising armies of the dead and draining the very essence of life from their enemies. The path to becoming a Necromancer requires not only exceptional magical talent and energy control but also a willingness to delve into forbidden knowledge and cross moral boundaries that most spellcasters would never approach. Those who succeed find themselves capable of commanding the dead and manipulating the boundary between life and death in ways that horrify conventional spellcasters. Necromancers typically operate from secluded lairs or ancient tombs, surrounded by their undead servants and macabre experiments. Many establish themselves as lords over small territories, using their undead minions to enforce their will and gather resources for their dark research. Some even become legendary figures whose mere mention causes fear and dread among common folk. Their combination of undead minions, life-draining abilities, and death magic makes them formidable opponents in any conflict, where their ability to replenish their forces from fallen enemies creates a steadily growing advantage as battles progress. Though they may lack the healing prowess of Channelers or the reality-bending capabilities of Eldritch practitioners, the minion control and self-sustainability of Necromancers make them perhaps the most relentless adversaries when attrition and sustained combat are factors."

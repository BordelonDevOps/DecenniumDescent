  "lore": "Conquerors represent the most dominating path a Battlemaster can take, having dedicated their martial prowess and leadership abilities to subjugating others through overwhelming force and fear. These masters of intimidation have transcended ordinary combat leadership to become terrifying figures of absolute authority, capable of breaking enemy will through sheer presence and forcing submission from all but the most resolute opponents. The path to becoming a Conqueror requires not only exceptional combat skills and tactical acumen but also a ruthless mindset that prioritizes dominance and control over all other considerations. Those who succeed find themselves capable of commanding through fear rather than respect, their very presence causing lesser warriors to question their resolve to fight. Conquerors typically serve as warlords of conquered territories, leaders of feared military forces, or personal enforcers for tyrannical rulers. Many establish their own domains through force, ruling with an iron fist and crushing any who dare to challenge their authority. Some even become legendary figures of such terrifying reputation that entire regions surrender rather than face their wrath. Their combination of overwhelming combat power, intimidating presence, and ruthless determination makes them feared opponents in any conflict, where their ability to break enemy morale before battle is even joined can prevent resistance from forming in the first place. Though they may lack the noble inspiration of Champions or the tactical precision of Warlords, the dominating presence and fear-inducing capabilities of Conquerors make them perhaps the most psychologically devastating battlefield commanders when submission through overwhelming force is the primary objective."

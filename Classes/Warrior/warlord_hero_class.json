  "lore": "Warlords represent the most pragmatic path a Battlemaster can take, having dedicated their martial prowess and leadership abilities to achieving victory through perfect strategy and tactical superiority. These master tacticians have transcended ordinary combat leadership to become unparalleled battlefield commanders, capable of turning even the most challenging military situation to their advantage through disciplined execution and strategic brilliance. The path to becoming a Warlord requires not only exceptional combat skills and tactical acumen but also a pragmatic mindset that prioritizes results over ideological considerations. Those who succeed find themselves capable of analyzing and controlling battlefield dynamics with unprecedented clarity, their tactical directives transforming even average soldiers into devastatingly effective fighting forces. Warlords typically serve as high-ranking military commanders, leaders of elite mercenary companies, or independent military advisors whose services are sought by those facing complex strategic challenges. Many establish their own military organizations built around their personal tactical doctrines, training officers and soldiers in their methodical approach to warfare. Some even become legendary strategists whose tactical innovations change the very nature of military conflict in their era. Their combination of personal combat prowess, tactical genius, and command presence makes them formidable opponents in any conflict, where their ability to coordinate allied forces and counter enemy strategies can overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. Though they may lack the inspirational presence of Champions or the intimidating dominance of Conquerors, the tactical brilliance and strategic adaptability of Warlords make them perhaps the most consistently effective battlefield commanders when victory through superior strategy is the primary objective."

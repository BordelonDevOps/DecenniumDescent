  "lore": "BloodCallers represent the darkest path a SpiritWalker can take, abandoning traditional spiritual magic in favor of blood rituals, forbidden alchemy, and the binding of spirits to physical vessels. These macabre practitioners have discovered that by infusing their blood with alchemical concoctions and spiritual essences, they can trigger powerful magical effects without the need for conventional spellcasting. The path to becoming a BloodCaller involves dangerous experimentation with one's own body, gradually replacing the natural connection to mana with an affinity for blood power and alchemical reactions. Those who survive this transformation find their bodies permanently altered—more resilient to toxins and capable of hosting multiple potion effects without the negative interactions that would kill ordinary beings. BloodCallers are feared and often shunned by other spiritual practitioners, who view their methods as a corruption of sacred traditions. Many operate as mercenaries, assassins, or battle-mages, using their unique abilities to devastating effect in combat. Some establish hidden laboratories where they conduct experiments on unwilling subjects, while others travel in search of rare ingredients and ancient alchemical knowledge. Their bodies, transformed by years of potion consumption and blood magic, often develop strange mutations that reflect their inner corruption—glowing eyes, unnaturally colored skin, or veins that visibly pulse with power beneath their skin. Despite the stigma attached to their practices, BloodCallers possess undeniable power, especially in combat situations where their ability to trigger multiple magical effects through their actions makes them unpredictable and deadly opponents."

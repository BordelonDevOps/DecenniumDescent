  "lore": "Soothsayers represent the pinnacle of divination and temporal insight among SpiritWalkers, having developed an unprecedented ability to perceive the threads of fate and commune with spirits of knowledge and time. These mystical seers have transcended ordinary perception, gaining the ability to glimpse past events with perfect clarity and potential futures with remarkable accuracy. The path to becoming a Soothsayer requires not only exceptional spiritual sensitivity but also a profound understanding of the interconnected nature of all events and a mind capable of processing complex temporal information. Those who succeed find themselves blessed with visions and insights that can guide entire communities through times of uncertainty and change. Soothsayers typically maintain a neutral stance in conflicts, understanding that maintaining the balance of fate often requires allowing both positive and negative events to unfold naturally. Many serve as advisors to leaders, providing guidance based on their visions while carefully avoiding direct interference in events that must occur. Others dedicate themselves to preserving historical knowledge, communing with spirits of the past to record events that might otherwise be lost to time. Their ability to project their consciousness across vast distances and even into other planes of existence makes them invaluable for gathering information that would be inaccessible by conventional means. Though they possess tremendous insight, Soothsayers understand the responsibility that comes with their power, knowing that revealing too much about the future can sometimes prevent necessary events from occurring or cause panic and chaos."

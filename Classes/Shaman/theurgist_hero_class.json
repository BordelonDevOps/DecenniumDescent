  "lore": "Theurgists represent the pinnacle of spiritual healing and divine communion among SpiritWalkers, having formed profound connections with benevolent spirits and divine entities. These compassionate healers have transcended the ordinary boundaries between mortal and divine, becoming living conduits for celestial power and spiritual light. The path to becoming a Theurgist requires not only exceptional spiritual sensitivity but also unwavering compassion and a genuine desire to alleviate suffering. Those who succeed find themselves blessed with unprecedented healing abilities that can mend both physical wounds and spiritual ailments that conventional medicine or magic cannot touch. Theurgists often serve as spiritual leaders in their communities, guiding others in proper reverence for benevolent spirits and divine entities while protecting them from malevolent influences. Many establish sanctuaries where the spiritually wounded can find healing and peace, while others travel to areas of spiritual corruption to cleanse and restore balance. Their ability to banish malevolent entities and close unauthorized portals between planes makes them particularly effective against demonic incursions and undead threats. Though they possess tremendous power, Theurgists use their abilities with humility and wisdom, understanding that they serve as vessels for divine will rather than wielders of power in their own right. Their presence alone can bring comfort to the suffering and strike fear into creatures of darkness, making them beacons of hope in troubled times."

This spell requires a significant number of available corpses in the target area.

### 6. Final Word
*   **School:** Necromancy [Death, Language-Dependent]
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One living creature with 50 hp or less
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You utter a single, potent word of unmaking. If the target creature has 50 hit points or fewer, it must make a Fortitude save. If it fails, it dies instantly. If the creature dies from this spell, you capture a fragment of its soul, which you can use once within the next hour to recall and cast any one spell of 5th level or lower that you know and have already expended today, without expending a spell slot. If the target succeeds on its save, it is instead stunned for 1 round.

### 7. Phantom Armageddon
*   **School:** Necromancy [Fear, Illusion, Mind-Affecting]
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Round
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, F (a shard from a tombstone struck by lightning)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** All enemies in a 60-ft.-radius burst
*   **Saving Throw:** Will disbelief (for illusion); Fortitude half (for necrotic damage)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You create a horrifying illusion of an apocalyptic event intertwined with waves of pure necrotic energy. All enemies in a 60-foot radius must make a Will save to disbelieve the illusionary component (e.g., skies raining blood, the ground opening to fiery pits, colossal skeletal figures). Regardless of the Will save, all enemies in the area take 12d8 points of necrotic damage (Fortitude save for half). Those who fail the Will save to disbelieve the illusion are also panicked for 1d4 rounds.

### 8. Eternal Pact
*   **School:** Necromancy
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 hour
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 25,000 gp, which is consumed, and a ritual involving your own blood)
*   **Duration:** Contingent (see text)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You forge a pact with the forces of undeath, ensuring your return from the brink. The next time you would be killed (reduced to -10 hit points or equivalent, or by a death effect), this spell triggers. You instead fall to 1 hit point, and all your expended spell slots of 8th level and lower are instantly refreshed. This effect occurs once, and then the spell is discharged. This spell does not protect against effects that utterly destroy the body or trap the soul in such a way that it cannot return to the body.

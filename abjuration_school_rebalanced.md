If you target a creature or object that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by a summon monster spell), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature.

You choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counterspell. A targeted dispel can end one spell for each four caster levels you possess, starting with the highest level spells and proceeding to lower level spells. An area dispel affects all magical effects within a 20-foot-radius burst. A counterspell functions just like dispel magic.

### 3. Nondetection

- **Description:** Remove curse can remove all curses on an object or a creature. If the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the DC of each curse affecting the target. Success means that the curse is removed. Remove curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although a successful caster level check enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it.

### 6. Spell Turning, Lesser
- **School:** Abjuration
- **Level:** 3

Once these spell levels have been turned, the spell ends. If you are targeted by a spell of higher level than the amount of spell turning you have left, that spell is partially turned. Subtract the amount of spell turning left from the spell level of the incoming spell, then divide the remaining levels of the incoming spell by the original spell level to see what fraction of the effect gets through. For damaging spells, you and the caster each take a fraction of the damage.

### 7. Dimensional Anchor

- **Description:** This powerful inscription harms those who enter, pass, or open the warded area or object. A glyph of warding can guard a bridge or passage, ward a portal, trap a chest or box, and so on. You set the conditions of the ward. Typically, any creature entering the warded area or opening the warded object without speaking a password (which you set when casting the spell) is subject to the magic it stores. When casting the spell, you select blast glyph or spell glyph. A blast glyph deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to the intruder and to all within 5 feet of him or her. A spell glyph can store any harmful spell of 3rd level or lower that you know.

- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
- **Description:** The subject becomes immune to the natural effects of a single plane of existence of your choice. These effects include such things as the enhanced gravity of the Plane of Earth, the lack of air on the Plane of Fire, the crushing pressure of the deep ocean, or the toxic atmosphere of certain layers of the Abyss. The spell does not protect against creatures or effects native to the plane, only against the inherent dangers of existing on that plane.

## Level 3 Evocation Spells

### 1. Flame Geyser (Fireball)
*   **School:** Evocation [Fire]
*   **Level:** 3

*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** 20-ft.-radius spread

*   **Description:** A fireball spell is an explosion of flame that detonates with a low roar and deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to every creature within the area. Unattended objects also take this damage. The explosion creates almost no pressure. You point your finger and determine the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A glowing, pea-sized bead streaks from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball at that point. If you attempt to send the bead through a narrow passage, such as through an arrow slit, you must “hit” the opening with a ranged touch attack, or else the bead strikes the barrier and detonates prematurely. The fireball sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in the area. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze.

### 2. Chain Lightning Jr. (Lightning Bolt)

*   **Description:** You release a powerful stroke of electrical energy that deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 10d6) to each creature within its area. The bolt begins at your fingertips. The lightning bolt sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals with a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze. Alternatively, you can choose to have the lightning strike a primary target for full damage, then arc to up to two additional targets within 30 feet of the primary (or each other), each taking half the damage rolled for the primary target.

*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex negates (blindness); Fortitude half (damage)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You create a blinding flash of arcane lightning. The spell brings forth light in a 60-foot radius. Creatures within 20 feet of the center of this flash must make a Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Additionally, these creatures take 3d6 points of electricity damage (Fortitude save for half). Creatures with light sensitivity are particularly affected by the flash.

### 5. Sleet Storm
*   **School:** Evocation [Cold]
*   **Level:** 3
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** Driving sleet blocks all sight (even darkvision) within it and causes the ground in the area to be icy. A creature can walk within or through the area of sleet at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can’t move in that round, while failure by 5 or more means it falls. The sleet extinguishes torches and small fires.

### 6. Wind Wall

*   **Level:** 3
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

*   **Saving Throw:** None; see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** An invisible vertical curtain of wind appears. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. It is a solid wall of wind, and any creature attempting to pass through it must make a Strength check (DC 10 + caster level) or be unable to penetrate. Loose materials and cloth garments fly upward when caught in a wind wall. Arrows and bolts are deflected upward and miss, while any other normal ranged weapon passing through the wall has a 30% miss chance. (Giant-thrown boulders, siege engine projectiles, and other massive ranged weapons are not affected.) Gases, most gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in gaseous form cannot pass through the wall (although it is no barrier to incorporeal creatures). While the wall must be vertical, you can shape it in a curve. The wind wall can be made into a ringed wall with a 5-foot radius.

## Level 4 Evocation Spells

### 1. Inferno Wave (Wall of Fire)
*   **School:** Evocation [Fire]
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF (a small piece of phosphorus)
*   **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Opaque sheet of shimmering flame up to 20 ft. long/level or a ring of fire with a radius of up to 5 ft./two levels; either form 20 ft. high
*   **Saving Throw:** None (see text)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** An immobile, blazing curtain of shimmering violet fire springs into existence. One side of the wall, selected by you, sends forth waves of heat, dealing 2d4 points of fire damage to creatures within 10 feet and 1d4 points of fire damage to those past 10 feet but within 20 feet. The wall deals this damage when it appears and on your turn each round to all creatures in the area. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature that passes through it. The wall also deals this damage to any creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of the wall on the heated side. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points of cold damage or more in 1 round, it is temporarily suppressed (it does not deal damage that round). An opaque wall of fire blocks line of sight. The "Inferno Wave" concept can be represented by the heat radiating from this wall and the damage on passing through.

### 2. Orb of Annihilation (Orb of Force)
*   **School:** Evocation [Force]

*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

The orb deals 1d6 points of force damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d6 at 10th level). For every two dice of damage, the orb also has a chance to knock the target prone; the target must make a Reflex save or be knocked down. (e.g., at 4d6 damage, DC is based on a 4th level spell). This is a more controlled force effect than a pure annihilation, fitting the Orb theme.

Each creature in the cylinder takes 3d6 points of bludgeoning damage and 2d6 points of cold damage. This spell does not create a slippery surface but the sheer volume of ice and hail makes the area difficult terrain for 1 round after the spell ends.

### 4. Voltaic Detonation (Shout)
*   **School:** Evocation [Electricity, Sonic]
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** 30 ft.
*   **Components:** V, S, F (a small metal cone)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Cone-shaped burst
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You emit an ear-splitting yell infused with electrical energy that deafens and damages creatures in its path. Any creature within the area is deafened for 2d6 rounds and takes 5d6 points of sonic/electricity damage. A successful save negates the deafness and halves the damage. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic/electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). An affected creature is stunned for 1 round if it fails its save against the damage.

### 5. Wall of Ice
*   **School:** Evocation [Cold]
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF (a small piece of quartz or other crystal)
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Anchored plane of ice or hemisphere of ice
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex for half damage if wall is broken
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** This spell creates an anchored plane of solid ice or a hemisphere of ice. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level caster can create a wall of ice 100 feet long and 10 feet high, or a 50-foot-long wall 20 feet high, and so on). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A wall of ice has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level. Even if breached, the wall deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level to any creature that passes through it (Reflex save for half). The hemisphere version creates a dome whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level.

### 6. Resilient Sphere
*   **School:** Evocation [Force]
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature or object (up to a 1-ft. diameter/level)
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere (the sphere can be up to 1 foot in diameter per caster level). The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a *disintegrate* spell or a *rod of cancellation*, *sphere of annihilation*, or *Mordenkainen’s disjunction*. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The sphere negates all targeted spells and effects. Area effects that include the sphere are not affected by it. The subject may struggle, but the sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.

## Level 5 Evocation Spells

### 1. Flame Typhoon (Cone of Cold - Fire version)
*   **School:** Evocation [Fire]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** 60 ft.
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF (a small crystal or glass cone, and a pinch of sulfur)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Cone-shaped burst
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** Cone of cold deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). The cone of fire is so intense it can briefly create a vortex effect, pulling unsecured Small or smaller objects towards the caster within the first 10 feet of the cone. Creatures caught in the cone take fire damage. (Adapting Cone of Cold to a fire theme for "Flame Typhoon").

### 2. Frozen Tomb (Wall of Force - Icy Prison)
*   **School:** Evocation [Cold, Force]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a small block of ice and a pinch of diamond dust worth 100 gp)
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex negates (entrapment); Fortitude partial (paralysis)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (for cold damage)
*   **Description:** You conjure a prison of magical ice and force around a single creature. The target must make a Reflex save. If it fails, it is encased in a tomb of shimmering, ice-hard force. The tomb is immobile and impervious to most damage (similar to *wall of force*). The creature inside is trapped. Each round on its turn, the trapped creature takes 5d8 points of cold damage and must make a Fortitude save or be paralyzed for that round by the intense cold. The tomb melts away when the spell ends. A creature can attempt to break free with a Strength check (DC 25) as a full-round action, but takes the cold damage and paralysis check regardless.

### 3. Meteor Spear (Flame Strike - modified)
*   **School:** Evocation [Fire, Divine]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Cylinder (10-ft. radius, 40 ft. high)
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You call down a column of roaring flame, shot through with streaks of molten rock, to smite an area. The spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. This functions as a vertical spear of meteoric impact.

### 4. Arc Surge (Chain Lightning - Lesser)
*   **School:** Evocation [Electricity]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or crystal; and three silver pins)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One primary target, plus one secondary target/level (each w/in 30 ft. of primary)
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike *lightning bolt*, *chain lightning* strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets. The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 15). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal half the damage dealt to the primary target. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

### 5. Cone of Cold
*   **School:** Evocation [Cold]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** 60 ft.
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF (a small crystal or glass cone)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Cone-shaped burst
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** Cone of cold creates an area of extreme cold, originating at your hand and blasting outward in a cone. It drains heat and deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6).

### 6. Wall of Force
*   **School:** Evocation [Force]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder made from a clear gem)
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** A wall of force spell creates an invisible wall of pure force. The wall cannot move, it is immune to damage of all kinds, and it is unaffected by most spells, including dispel magic. However, disintegrate immediately destroys it, as does a rod of cancellation, a sphere of annihilation, or a Mordenkainen’s disjunction spell. Breath weapons and spells cannot pass through the wall in either direction, although dimension door, teleport, and similar effects can bypass the barrier. It blocks ethereal creatures as well as material ones (though ethereal creatures can pass through material barriers beyond the wall of force). Gaze attacks can operate through a wall of force.

## Level 6 Evocation Spells

### 1. Solar Flare (Sunburst - modified)
*   **School:** Evocation [Fire, Light]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF (a piece of sunstone)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** 60-ft.-radius burst
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex partial (see text)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** Sunburst causes a globe of searing radiance to explode silently from a point you select. All creatures in the globe are blinded and take 6d6 points of fire damage. A successful Reflex save negates the blindness and reduces the damage to half. Undead creatures, and creatures particularly vulnerable to light (such as certain oozes and fungi), take 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6), and they are destroyed utterly if they fail their saves. The ultraviolet light generated by the spell deals damage to fungi, mold, oozes, and slimes as if they were undead creatures. This functions as a powerful flashbang and area denial.

### 2. Absolute Zero (Otiluke's Freezing Sphere - modified)
*   **School:** Evocation [Cold]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous or 1 round/level (see text)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Ray or 10-ft.-radius burst
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half (for burst); Fortitude negates (entombment)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You can use this spell in two ways:
    *   **Ray:** You fire a frigid ray at a single target. Make a ranged touch attack. If it hits, the target takes 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). If this damage is enough to reduce the target to 0 hp or fewer, the target is flash-frozen into a solid block of ice and is considered helpless and stable (but not dead). The ice melts in 1d4 hours or can be broken (hardness 0, 15 hp per inch of thickness).
    *   **Burst (Absolute Zero):** You create a sphere of intense cold that detonates at a point you choose. All creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst take 1d6 cold damage per caster level (maximum 15d6, Reflex half). Any creature that fails its save is also encased in a thin layer of magical ice, making them unable to move or take actions (entombed) for 1 round. They can attempt a Fortitude save at the end of their turn to break free. This version represents the "Absolute Zero" concept more directly.

### 3. Arcane Mortar (Acid Fog)
*   **School:** Evocation [Acid, Conjuration]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF (powdered peas and an animal hoof)
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Fog spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** This spell creates a roiling cloud of acidic fog similar to *fog cloud*, except that its vapors are highly acidic. In addition to the effects of *fog cloud* (obscuring sight), creatures in the acid fog take 2d6 points of acid damage each round on your turn. This functions as a persistent area denial, like an arcane mortar shelling an area with acid.

### 4. Sonic Collapse (Shout, Greater)
*   **School:** Evocation [Sonic]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** 60 ft.
*   **Components:** V, S, F (a large metal cone)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Cone-shaped burst
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** This spell functions like *shout*, except that it deals 10d6 points of sonic damage, and the deafness lasts for 4d6 rounds. A successful save negates the deafness and halves the damage. Any exposed brittle or crystalline object or crystalline creature takes 1d6 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). An affected creature is stunned for 1d4 rounds if it fails its save against the damage. The sheer force can cause collapse in weak structures (GM discretion).

### 5. Chain Lightning
*   **School:** Evocation [Electricity]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or crystal; and three silver pins)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One primary target, plus one secondary target/level (each w/in 30 ft. of primary)
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from your fingertips. Unlike *lightning bolt*, *chain lightning* strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets. The bolt deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to the primary target. After it strikes, lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to your caster level (maximum 20). The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal half the damage dealt to the primary target. You choose secondary targets as you like, but they must all be within 30 feet of the primary target, and no target can be struck more than once. You can choose to affect fewer secondary targets than the maximum.

### 6. Contingency
*   **School:** Evocation [Universal]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Personal or touch (for companion spell)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (quicksilver, an eyelash from a hare, and an item of at least 1,500 gp value that is a focus for the contingent spell)
*   **Duration:** 1 day/level (D) or until discharged
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You (or creature touched for companion spell)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You can place another spell upon your person or another willing creature so that it will come into effect under some condition you dictate. The contingency spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both spells. If the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. The companion spell must be one that affects your person (or the chosen recipient) and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level). The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. The companion spell occurs instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (contingency and the companion magic) may fail when called on.

## Level 7 Evocation Spells

### 1. Lightning Grave (Delayed Blast Fireball - Lightning Version)
*   **School:** Evocation [Electricity]
*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur, plus a copper wire)
*   **Duration:** Concentration, up to 5 rounds, or instantaneous; see text
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** 20-ft.-radius spread
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** A small, glowing bead of electrical energy streaks from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range, where it blossoms into a roaring sphere of lightning. The spell functions like *fireball*, except that it deals electricity damage. You can choose to have the bead detonate on impact, or you can delay the detonation for up to 5 rounds. You select the length of the delay at the time of casting, and the delay cannot be changed once set unless you concentrate on the bead. If you concentrate, you can choose to have the bead detonate at any time during the concentration. If you cease concentrating before the chosen delay is reached, the bead detonates immediately. The bead explodes if it strikes a solid barrier before reaching the target point. The lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 20d6). The "Lightning Grave" concept is that if a creature is marked (i.e., the bead is near them) and they move or act in a way that triggers the detonation, it explodes.

### 2. Pyroclasm (Fire Storm)
*   **School:** Evocation [Fire]
*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Two 10-ft. cubes per caster level (S)
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** A fire storm spell creates a maelstrom of roaring flame. The spell deals 1d6 points of fire damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) to all creatures and objects within its area. You can choose to affect an area as small as a single 10-foot cube, or a number of 10-foot cubes equal to your caster level. These cubes must be contiguous. The fire damages objects in the area and ignites combustibles. If a creature is in an area of fire storm for more than 1 round, it takes damage each round on your turn.

### 3. Frost Reaver (Control Weather - Localized Blizzard)
*   **School:** Evocation [Cold, Air]
*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** 2 miles
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** 4d12 hours (D); see text
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** 2-mile-radius circle, centered on you
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You alter the weather in the local area. It takes 10 minutes to cast the spell and an additional 10 minutes for the effects to manifest. You can call forth a localized blizzard (extreme cold, heavy snow, strong winds) in a 1-mile radius centered on a point you choose within the spell's range. Creatures in the blizzard take 1d6 cold damage per 10 minutes of exposure, visibility is severely limited, and movement is hampered. The "Frost Reaver" aspect is that a specific target you designate when casting (if within the blizzard's initial area) takes 8d8 cold damage immediately when the blizzard manifests and is slowed (as the *slow* spell) for as long as they remain in the blizzard, with no save against the initial damage or slow if they are the designated target. The general blizzard effects apply to all others.

### 4. Arcbolt Singularity (Prismatic Spray)
*   **School:** Evocation [Various]
*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** 60 ft.
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Cone-shaped burst
*   **Saving Throw:** See text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** This spell causes seven shimmering, multicolored beams of light to spray from your hand. Each beam has a different power. Creatures in the area of the spell with 8 HD or less are automatically blinded for 2d4 rounds. Every creature in the area is randomly struck by one or more beams, which have additional effects:
    *   1 (Red): 20 points fire damage (Reflex half).
    *   2 (Orange): 40 points acid damage (Reflex half).
    *   3 (Yellow): 80 points electricity damage (Reflex half).
    *   4 (Green): Poison (Fortitude save or die; successful save means 1d6 Con damage).
    *   5 (Blue): Turned to stone (Fortitude save negates).
    *   6 (Indigo): Sent to another plane (Will save negates).
    *   7 (Violet): Insanity (Will save negates).
    *   8: Struck by two rays; roll twice more, ignoring any further 8s.
    This represents the chaotic, multi-energy output of an "Arcbolt Singularity."

### 5. Mordenkainen’s Sword
*   **School:** Evocation [Force]
*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S, F (a miniature platinum sword worth 250 gp)
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One sword-like plane of force
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers in the air and attacks opponents at a distance, as you direct it, starting in the round that you cast the spell. The sword attacks with your base attack bonus (possibly allowing it multiple attacks per round in subsequent rounds) plus your spellcasting ability modifier as an attack bonus. It deals 4d6+3 points of force damage. The sword always strikes from your direction. It cannot flank targets as a creature could. If the sword goes beyond the spell range, if it goes out of your sight, or if you are not directing it, the sword returns to you and hovers.

### 6. Forcecage
*   **School:** Evocation [Force]
*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)
*   **Duration:** 2 hours/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Cage of force (see text)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** This powerful spell brings into being an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice). Creatures within the area are trapped inside. The forcecage is immune to damage and most spells. Spells and breath weapons cannot pass through a solid forcecage. A forcecage made of bars is 1/2 inch thick. A creature inside cannot pass through the bars unless it can fit through a 1/2-inch-wide space. The barred version provides cover (+4 AC, +2 on Reflex saves) to creatures inside it. The solid version is a 20-foot cube and blocks line of effect for all spells and attacks.

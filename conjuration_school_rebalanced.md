- **Components:** V, S, M (a small square of cloth, a small square of wood, and a small nail)
- **Duration:** 2 hours/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** 20-ft.-square structure
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** You conjure a sturdy cottage or lodge made of material that is common in the area where the spell is cast. The floor is level, clean, and dry. The lodging resembles a normal cottage, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a small fireplace. The shelter has no heating or cooling source (other than natural insulation qualities). Therefore, it must be heated as a normal dwelling, and extreme heat adversely affects it and its occupants. The dwelling does, however, provide considerable security otherwise—it is as strong as a normal stone building, regardless of its material composition.

### 6. Solid Fog
- **School:** Conjuration [Creation]
- **Level:** 4
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dried, powdered peas combined with powdered animal hoof)
- **Duration:** 1 minute/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** 20-ft.-radius spread, 20 ft. high
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** This spell functions like fog cloud, but in addition to obscuring sight, the solid fog is so thick that it impedes movement. Creatures moving through a solid fog move at half their normal speed and take a –2 penalty on all melee attack and melee damage rolls. The vapors prevent effective ranged weapon attacks (except for magic rays and the like). A creature or object that falls into solid fog is slowed, so that each 10 feet of vapor that it passes through reduces falling damage by 1d6.

### 7. Minor Creation
- **School:** Conjuration [Creation]
- **Level:** 4
- **Casting Time:** 1 Minute
- **Range:** 0 ft.
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same sort of item you plan to create)
- **Duration:** 1 hour/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** Unattended, nonmagical object of nonliving plant matter, up to 1 cu. ft./level
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** You create a nonmagical, unattended object of nonliving, vegetable matter. The volume of the item created cannot exceed 1 cubic foot per caster level. You must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. Attempting to use any created object as a material component causes the spell to fail.

### 8. Planar Ally, Lesser
- **School:** Conjuration [Calling]
- **Level:** 4
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Components:** V, S, M (offerings worth 500 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One called elemental or outsider of 6 HD or less
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** By casting this spell, you request your deity to send you an elemental or outsider (of 6 HD or less) of the deity's choice. If you serve no particular deity, the spell is a general plea answered by a creature sharing your philosophical alignment. If you know an individual creature's name, you may request that individual by speaking the name during the spell (though you might get a different creature anyway). You may ask the creature to perform one task in exchange for a payment from you. Tasks might range from the simple (fly us across the chasm, help us fight a battle) to the complex (spy on our enemies, protect us on our foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature called in order to bargain for its services.

- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

You can double the wall's area by halving its thickness. The wall cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as a creature or another object. Unlike a wall of iron, you can create a wall of stone in almost any shape you desire. The wall created need not be vertical, nor rest upon any firm foundation; however, it must merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. It can be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or as a ramp.

- **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** This spell generates a bank of fog, similar to a fog cloud, except that its vapors are yellowish green and poisonous. These vapors automatically kill any living creature with 3 or fewer HD (no save). A living creature with 4 to 6 HD is slain unless it succeeds on a Fortitude save (in which case it takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud). A living creature with 6 or more HD takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage on your turn each round while in the cloud (a successful Fortitude save halves this damage). Holding one's breath doesn't help, but creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the spell.

The called creature is held in the trap until it agrees to perform one service in return for its freedom. The kind of creature to be bound must be known and stated. If you wish to call a specific individual, you must use that individual's proper name in casting the spell. The target creature is allowed a Will saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature resists the spell. If the saving throw fails, the creature is immediately drawn to the trap.

The chest can contain up to 1 cubic foot of material per caster level (regardless of the chest's actual size, which is about 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).

- **Target/Area of Effect:** Magical hound
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** You conjure up a phantom watchdog that is invisible to everyone but yourself. It then guards the area where it was conjured. The hound immediately starts barking loudly if any Small or larger creature approaches within 30 feet of it. (Those within 30 feet of the hound when it is conjured may move about in the area, but if they leave and return, they activate the barking.) The hound sees invisible and ethereal creatures. It does not react to figments, but it does react to shadow illusions. If an intruder approaches to within 5 feet of the hound, the dog stops barking and delivers a vicious bite (+10 attack bonus, 2d6+3 points of piercing damage) once per round.

Once observers have passed beyond the entrance, they are in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the subject. On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the maze spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as teleport and dimension door, do not help a creature escape a maze spell, although a plane shift spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell.

### 3. Planar Binding, Greater
- **School:** Conjuration [Calling]
- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes

- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** Cloud spreads in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high
- **Saving Throw:** Reflex half; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** An incendiary cloud spell creates a cloud of roiling smoke shot through with white-hot embers. The smoke obscures all sight as a fog cloud does. In addition, the white-hot embers within the cloud deal 6d6 points of fire damage to everything within the cloud on your turn each round. All targets can make Reflex saves each round to take half damage. As with a cloudkill spell, the smoke moves away from you at 10 feet per round. Figure out the smoke's new spread each round based on its new point of origin, which is 10 feet farther away from where you were when you cast the spell. By concentrating, you can make the cloud move as much as 60 feet each round. Any portion of the cloud that would extend beyond your maximum range dissipates harmlessly, reducing the remainder's spread thereafter.

### 6. Teleportation Circle
- **School:** Conjuration [Teleportation]
- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 0 ft.
- **Components:** V, M (amber dust to cover circle worth 1,000 gp)
- **Duration:** 10 min./level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** 5-ft.-radius circle that teleports those who activate it
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You create a circle on the floor or other horizontal surface that teleports, as greater teleport, any creature who stands on it to a designated spot. Once you designate the destination for the circle, you can't change it. The spell fails if you attempt to set the circle to teleport creatures into a solid object, to a place with which you are not familiar and have no clear description, or to another plane. The circle itself is subtle and nearly impossible to notice. If you intend to keep creatures from activating it accidentally, you need to mark the circle in some way.

### 7. Create Demiplane, Lesser
- **School:** Conjuration [Creation]
- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 4 hours
- **Range:** 0 ft.
- **Components:** V, S, M (a forked metal rod worth at least 500 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 day/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** 30-ft. cube/level (S)
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** You create a small demiplane. You must be on the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane when you cast this spell. When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal plane. It is filled with air or water (your choice). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The "walls" and "ceiling" of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane's environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane's light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.

### 8. Dimensional Lock
- **School:** Conjuration [Teleportation]
- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 day/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a point in space
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You create a shimmering emerald barrier that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred include astral projection, blink, dimension door, ethereal jaunt, etherealness, gate, maze, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar spell-like abilities. Once dimensional lock is in place, extradimensional travel into or out of the area is not possible. A dimensional lock does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, the spell does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.

Second, you may then call a particular individual or kind of being through the gate. The gate itself is a circular hoop or disk from 5 to 20 feet in diameter (caster's choice) oriented in the direction you desire when it comes into existence (typically vertical and facing you). It is a two-dimensional window looking into the plane you specified when casting the spell, and anyone or anything that moves through is shunted instantly to the other side.

- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** You create powerful magic in a specially prepared object. This object contains the power to instantly transport its possessor across any distance within the same plane to your abode. Once the item is transmuted, you must give it willingly to a creature and at the same time inform it of a command word to be spoken when the item is used. To make use of the item, the subject speaks the command word at the same time that it rends or breaks the item (a standard action). When this is done, the possessor and all objects it is wearing and carrying (to a maximum of the possessor's heavy load) are instantly transported to your abode. No other creatures are affected (aside from a familiar or animal companion that is touching the subject).

### 7. Astral Projection

You can bring the astral forms of other willing creatures with you, provided that these subjects are linked in a circle with you at the time of the casting. These fellow travelers are dependent upon you and must accompany you at all times. If something happens to you during the journey, your companions are stranded wherever you left them. You project your astral self onto the Astral Plane, leaving your physical body behind on the Material Plane in a state of suspended animation. The spell projects an astral copy of you and all you wear or carry onto the Astral Plane.

### 8. Divine Summoning

Additionally, the creature gains 2 additional Hit Dice, a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Constitution, and spell resistance equal to 10 + your caster level. The summoned creature serves you loyally for the duration of the spell, obeying your commands and fighting on your behalf. Unlike other summoning spells, the creature remains for hours rather than rounds, making this a powerful spell for securing a divine ally for an extended period.

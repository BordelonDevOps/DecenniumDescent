The weapon retains its general properties (like being made of metal or wood) but adopts the damage type, critical threat range, and critical multiplier of the new form. For example, you could transmute a dagger (1d4 piercing, 19-20/x2) into a short sword (1d6 piercing, 19-20/x2) or a handaxe (1d6 slashing, x3). The weapon reverts to its original form when the duration expires.

While it takes a full-round action to shape the stone, the change is instantaneous once you complete the casting. You can crudely shape a stone weapon or tool, create a stone door from a stone wall, bridge a chasm with a stone span, or create a simple trap like a pit. This spell cannot be used to create complex moving parts or fine details. The volume of stone you can affect is 10 cubic feet, plus 1 cubic foot per caster level.

If it fails, the chosen limb becomes stiff and unresponsive. If an arm is disabled, the creature has disadvantage (or a -4 penalty) on attack rolls, Strength and Dexterity checks requiring that arm, and cannot hold items in that hand.

*   **Description:** You assume the form of a different humanoid creature of your own creature type (e.g., a human could become an elf or an orc, but not a monstrous humanoid or an outsider). You gain the physical qualities of the new form while retaining your own mind. You gain a +2 size bonus to one physical ability score (Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution) of your choice. You also gain any natural armor, natural weapons (like claws or a bite), movement modes (like a swim or climb speed), and extraordinary special attacks (like scent) of the new form, but you do not gain any supernatural or spell-like abilities.

Additionally, it takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves.

The target's appearance changes subtly to reflect the chosen trait (e.g., slightly larger pupils for darkvision, webbed fingers for swim speed). A creature can only benefit from one *formshift* spell at a time.

### 4. Shatter Earth

*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless, object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless, object)

You can’t cast this spell on a natural weapon, such as a claw or bite attack.

Using a fly spell requires only as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally.

*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You attempt to magically lock a creature into its current physical form. The target must make a Will save. If it fails, it cannot willingly change its shape or form for the duration. This prevents the use of polymorph effects (like *alter self*, *wild shape*, *gaseous form*), assuming a hybrid form, or any other ability that changes its physical structure. It does not prevent illusions or disguises that don't alter the underlying form.

### 5. Stone Skin
*   **School:** Transmutation [Earth]
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, S, M (granite and diamond dust worth 250 gp)
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level or until discharged
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Creature touched
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
*   **Description:** The subject gains damage reduction 10/adamantine. It ignores the first 10 points of damage from each attack that would normally deal hit point damage from a weapon or a natural attack. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.

### 6. Polymorph Self
*   **School:** Transmutation [Polymorph]
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of the creature whose form you plan to take, or a general representation)
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You change your form, taking on the appearance and many of the abilities of another creature. You can assume the form of any Small or Medium creature of the animal, humanoid, or elemental type. You gain the new form’s physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution), size, speed, natural armor, natural attacks (claws, bite, etc.), and movement modes (fly, swim, burrow, etc.). You retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. You do not gain the new form’s extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities. Your gear melds into your new form and becomes nonfunctional.

## Level 5 Transmutation Spells

### 1. Transmute Terrain
*   **School:** Transmutation [Earth, Water, Air, Fire - as appropriate]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a sample of the desired terrain type, e.g., sand for desert, mud for swamp)
*   **Duration:** 24 hours (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Up to a 60-ft.-radius area
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You permanently alter the terrain in a large area. You can change one type of terrain into another common type (e.g., forest to plains, swamp to solid ground, sand to shallow water, or vice versa). The new terrain is mundane and non-magical. This cannot create valuable materials (like turning rock into gold) or inherently dangerous terrain (like a lava field, unless lava is a natural feature of the area being transmuted from). The transformation is gradual over the casting time. The DM determines the exact nature and limitations of the terrain change.

### 2. Ironskin Legion
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a small iron ingot)
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Up to one willing creature per two caster levels, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** The skin of the affected creatures turns to a dull, iron-like sheen. Each target gains a +2 enhancement bonus to their natural armor (or a +2 natural armor bonus if they have none) and Damage Reduction 5/adamantine against bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. This DR does not stack with other forms of DR.

### 3. Petrify Limb
*   **School:** Transmutation [Earth]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, F (a pebble from a petrified creature)
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D) or permanent (see text)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One living creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You attempt to turn one of the target’s limbs (arm or leg, your choice) to stone. The target must make a Fortitude save. If it fails, the chosen limb becomes petrified – heavy, unresponsive, and stone-like. If an arm is petrified, the creature drops anything held in that hand, cannot use that arm for attacks or skills, and takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity. If a leg is petrified, the creature’s movement speed is reduced to 5 feet, and it falls prone. If the creature fails three consecutive Fortitude saves against this spell (either from multiple castings or if the spell allows repeated saves, which this version does not imply for permanence), the petrification of the limb becomes permanent until magically reversed. Otherwise, the effect lasts for the duration.

### 4. Magnetize Field
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** 20-ft.-radius spread
*   **Saving Throw:** Strength negates (see text)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object/creature)
*   **Description:** You create a powerful magnetic field in a 20-foot radius. All creatures wearing significant metal armor (medium or heavy) or primarily composed of metal within the area must make a Strength save or be pulled 10 feet towards the center of the effect each round at the start of their turn. If this movement is impeded by a solid object or another creature, they stop. Unattended metal objects weighing up to 50 lbs are pulled to the center. Creatures attempting to move out of the field while wearing metal armor must make a Strength check (DC 15 + your caster level) to do so. Attacks with metallic weapons made into or out of the field take a -2 penalty.

### 5. Baleful Polymorph
*   **School:** Transmutation [Polymorph]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
*   **Duration:** Permanent (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates, Will partial (see text)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You change a subject into a Small or smaller, harmless animal (such as a squirrel, rabbit, or frog; CR 1/4 or less). The subject must make a Fortitude save to negate the transformation. If the save fails, the creature is transformed. If the subject fails this save, it must then make a Will save. If this second save also fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to speak, and its Intelligence score becomes 1. It still retains its personality and memories (unless its new Int is too low to support them). If the Will save succeeds, the creature retains its mind and mental abilities, but is still trapped in the animal form. In animal form, the subject retains its hit points. Its new Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores are those of the animal form. The creature’s new AC is its new Dexterity modifier + its new natural armor (if any). It cannot cast spells or use most equipment.

### 6. Passwall
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame)
*   **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One passage through a wooden, plaster, or stone wall
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You create a passage through wooden, plaster, or stone walls, but not through metal or other harder materials. The passage is 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 10 feet deep. If the wall’s thickness is more than 10 feet, you can create a passage up to 20 feet deep by doubling the casting time. You can’t create a passage that would cause a structure to collapse. The passage is open to all creatures that can fit through it.

## Level 6 Transmutation Spells

### 1. Elemental Rebind
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a sample of the element to be inflicted - e.g., a lit match for fire, a shard of ice for cold)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous (damage); 1 round/level (vulnerability)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates vulnerability; Reflex half for damage
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You attempt to strip a creature of its natural or magical defenses against a chosen energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) and then blast it with that energy. The target must make a Fortitude save. If it fails, it loses any immunity or resistance it has to the chosen energy type for 1 round per caster level, and instead gains vulnerability to that energy type (takes +50% damage from it). Whether the save succeeds or fails, the target immediately takes 5d10 points of damage of the chosen energy type (Reflex save for half damage).

### 2. Earthstep
*   **School:** Transmutation [Earth]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V, S, DF
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You gain the ability to move through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. Your burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of your presence. You can move at your normal land speed. This spell does not allow you to see through the earth, so you must have another means of navigating (such as tremorsense or knowing your path). You cannot take other creatures with you.

### 3. Metaburst
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Touch

*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Willing creature touched
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)

*   **Description:** You infuse a creature with potent transmutative energy, heightening one of its physical attributes to an extraordinary degree. Choose Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. The target gains a +4 enhancement bonus to the chosen ability score. Additionally, for the duration, the target gains advantage on all skill checks and saving throws related to that ability score (e.g., if Strength is chosen, advantage on Climb checks and Strength-based saves). A creature can only benefit from one *metaburst* spell at a time.

### 4. Displace Structure
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature replica of the structure made of clay, which is consumed)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One building or structure up to 20 ft. square per caster level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You magically move or rotate a single, non-magical building or freestanding structure. You can move the structure up to 30 feet in any direction along the ground, or rotate it up to 90 degrees on its central axis. The movement is smooth and does not damage the structure or its mundane contents, though creatures inside will feel the motion. This spell cannot move structures that are magically warded against such effects or that are part of a much larger connected complex unless the entire complex is within the size limit.

### 5. Flesh to Stone
*   **School:** Transmutation [Earth]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

*   **Duration:** Instantaneous (see text)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One living creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** The subject, along with all its carried gear, turns into a mindless, inert statue. If the statue resulting from this spell is broken or damaged, the subject (if ever returned to its original state) has similar damage or deformities. The creature is not dead, but it does not seem to be alive either when viewed with spells like *deathwatch*. Only creatures made of flesh are affected by this spell.

### 6. Stone to Flesh
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One petrified creature or a cylinder of stone from 1 ft. to 3 ft. in diameter and up to 10 ft. long
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates (object); see text
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)
*   **Description:** This spell restores a petrified creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to survive the process. If the save is failed, the creature dies, but its body is still restored. This spell can also convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking vital life functions unless specific life-giving magic is then applied.

*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)
*   **Description:** You transmute all non-magical metal objects within a 20-foot radius into fragile, ordinary glass. This includes weapons, armor, and other metal items. Affected items retain their shape but become made of glass, rendering them mostly useless (e.g., glass armor shatters on the first hit, glass weapons break on impact). Wielded or attended items get a Will save (made by the wielder/attendant) to negate the effect for that item. Magical metal items are unaffected.

*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial (see text)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You instantly encase a target in a thick layer of magical ice. The target takes 6d10 points of cold damage and is restrained for 1 round (Fortitude save for half damage and to negate the restrained condition). Even if the save is successful against being restrained, the target takes an additional 2d10 cold damage per round for the next 1d4 rounds as frost continues to bite at them (this ongoing damage is not subject to a save if the initial save against restraint failed, but is halved if the initial save for damage was successful).

### 4. Transmute Being

*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

The target gains the chosen creature’s physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution), size (up to Large), speed, natural armor, natural attacks, and movement modes. It retains its own Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, level, class, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, alignment, and mental abilities. It does not gain the new form’s extraordinary (unless purely physical, like Scent), supernatural, or spell-like abilities. The target’s gear melds into the new form. The specific statistics of the assumed form should be based on a typical creature of that type (e.g., a bear for animal, a Large fire elemental for elemental).

### 5. Statue
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal or Touch

### 6. Control Weather

You can call forth weather appropriate to the climate and season of the area you are in. You can cause a 1-step change in temperature (e.g., from hot to warm, or cold to very cold), cause precipitation (rain, snow, sleet, or hail), or change wind conditions (from calm to strong wind, or vice versa). You cannot create weather phenomena that are out of season (e.g., a blizzard in summer). The DM has final say on what weather can be created.

It moves along the ground at a speed of 30 feet per round as you direct it (a move action). The fortress can house up to 10 Medium creatures comfortably.

Additionally, any creature that fails its Reflex save and is in the direct path of the spike (typically one creature in the center of the 5ft radius) is impaled and carried 30 feet into the air, taking an additional 3d6 falling damage when the spike retracts at the end of your turn unless they have a means to avoid falling.

The creature is not aware of its surroundings or the passage of time. If cast on an object, the object is protected from decay, rust, or any other natural degradation.

*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One living creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You attempt to unravel a creature's physical form and convert it into raw magical energy. The target must make a Fortitude save. If it fails, its body explodes in a devastating blast of energy of a type you choose (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The target is slain, and all creatures within a 20-foot radius of the target (including the space it occupied) take 12d10 points of damage of the chosen energy type (Reflex save for half damage). This damage bypasses all energy resistances of the creatures in the blast. If the target succeeds on its Fortitude save, it instead takes 10d6 points of force damage as its form is violently stressed but not fully converted.

### 2. Timeless Form
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp)

*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You step partially outside the normal flow of time, becoming immune to its ravages and manipulations. For the duration, you are immune to magical aging effects, the *haste* and *slow* spells (and similar effects), and any effect that would alter your personal timeline or speed (such as *time stop*, though you would still be frozen if someone else cast it). You age normally for the duration of the spell itself, but no more. You also gain a +4 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves as you can subtly anticipate and react to events slightly before they occur.

### 3. Reverse Gravity Field
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of iron filings)
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** All creatures and objects not fixed to the ground in a 60-ft.-radius, 100-ft.-high cylinder
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex negates (see text)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You reverse gravity in a large cylindrical area. All creatures and objects that are not somehow anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the top of the area in 1 round. If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration. At the end of the spell’s duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward. A creature can make a Reflex save to grab onto a fixed object to avoid falling upward; creatures that can fly or levitate can keep from falling.

### 4. Eternal Anvil
*   **School:** Transmutation [Creation]
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, F (a miniature silver hammer worth 250 gp)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature or object
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude partial (stun); Reflex avoids (object)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You summon a colossal, spectral war-anvil that slams down upon a target you designate. Make a melee spell attack against the target (using your caster level + casting stat modifier). If it hits a creature, the target takes 5d12 points of force damage and must make a Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. If it hits an object, it deals 10d12 points of force damage (bypassing hardness). Unattended objects do not get a save. If the target is a structure, this spell deals double damage.

### 5. Matter Conversion
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 hour
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a sample of the original material and a sample of the desired material, plus rare catalysts worth 5,000 gp, consumed)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Up to 10 cubic feet of non-magical material per caster level
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You convert a large volume of one non-magical, mundane material into an equal volume of another non-magical, mundane material. For example, you could turn a 10-foot cube of stone into a 10-foot cube of wood, or a pile of sand into a pile of iron. You cannot create precious materials (like gold, platinum, or gemstones) or magical materials (like adamantine or mithral) with this spell. The process is slow and requires intense concentration. The created material is permanent and mundane.

### 6. Elemental Shell
*   **School:** Transmutation [Abjuration]
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a perfect gemstone corresponding to the chosen element - e.g., ruby for fire, sapphire for cold, topaz for electricity, emerald for acid, diamond for sonic - worth 1,000 gp, consumed)
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You sheathe yourself in a protective shell of pure elemental energy. Choose one energy type: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You become immune to damage from that energy type for the duration. Furthermore, any creature striking you with a melee attack or a natural weapon takes 3d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. Spells and effects that deal damage of the chosen type are harmlessly absorbed by the shell. If a spell has multiple energy types, only the chosen type is negated.

### 7. Body to Void
*   **School:** Transmutation
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** 3 rounds (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You transform your physical body into an intangible field of shimmering, void-like energy. For 3 rounds, you are incorporeal. You gain all the benefits of the incorporeal subtype: you have no physical body, you are immune to all nonmagical attack forms, and you take only half damage from corporeal magical sources (except for force effects or attacks made with ghost touch weapons, which affect you normally). You can pass through solid objects at will (though not force effects). You cannot make physical attacks or manipulate objects, but you can cast spells with only verbal components. You can be targeted by spells as normal for an incorporeal creature. You revert to your normal form at the end of the 3rd round, or you can dismiss the effect as a free action.

### 8. Reality Anchor
*   **School:** Transmutation [Abjuration]
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** 100-ft.-radius emanation centered on you
*   **Components:** V, S, F (a perfectly balanced gyroscope made of adamantine worth 5,000 gp)
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** 100-ft.-radius emanation
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** See text
*   **Description:** You create a field that stabilizes reality, suppressing or negating transmutation effects. Within the emanation, no new transmutation spells or spell-like abilities of 8th level or lower can be cast or take effect. Ongoing transmutation effects of 8th level or lower are suppressed (but not dispelled) while within the area. Transmutation effects of 9th level have a 50% chance of failing or being suppressed. Creatures in polymorphed forms must make a Will save (DC 20 + your caster level) each round they remain in the area or revert to their true form. This field does not affect instantaneous transmutation effects that have already occurred (e.g., an object already transmuted by *matter conversion* remains as it is).

If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it receives a +5 bonus on its saving throw. The spell does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must win an opposed Charisma check to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do. (Retries are not allowed.) An affected creature never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing.

Among creatures with equal HD, those who are closest to the spell's point of origin are affected first. HD that are not sufficient to affect a creature are wasted. Sleeping creatures are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected creature, but normal noise does not. Awakening a creature is a standard action (an application of the aid another action).

In addition, you can suggest a course of action to the subject while it is fascinated. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the activity sound reasonable. The suggested course of activity can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can instead specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. If the condition is not met before the spell duration expires, the activity is not performed.

If the save succeeds, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of the spell. If the save fails, the opponent can't follow through with the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can't directly attack the warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject remain unaffected. This spell does not prevent the warded creature from being attacked or affected by area of effect spells. The subject cannot attack without breaking the spell but may use non-attack spells or otherwise act.

Creatures so affected cannot take violent actions (although they can defend themselves) or do anything destructive. Any aggressive action against or damage dealt to a calmed creature immediately breaks the spell on all calmed creatures. This spell automatically suppresses (but does not dispel) any morale bonuses granted by spells such as bless, good hope, and rage, and also negates a bard's ability to inspire courage or a barbarian's rage ability.

Any potentially affected creature of a race or religion unfriendly to yours gets a +4 bonus on the saving throw.

- **Duration:** 1 day/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One humanoid
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You can control the actions of any humanoid creature through a telepathic link that you establish with the subject's mind. If you and the subject have a common language, you can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. If no common language exists, you can communicate only basic commands, such as "Come here," "Go there," "Fight," and "Stand still." You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it, nor can it communicate with you telepathically. Once you have given a dominated creature a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Sense Motive check against DC 15 (rather than DC 25) can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by an enchantment effect.

### 7. Modify Memory

If the subject fails its saving throw, you can proceed with the spell. To modify the subject's memory, you must spend at least 1 minute describing the event as you wish the subject to remember it. If the spell ends before you've finished describing the modified memory, the subject remembers the original memory.

### 8. Overwhelming Sorrow

- **Description:** This spell functions like overwhelming grief, except that it affects multiple targets. Each affected creature falls prone and cannot take actions for the duration of the spell. Even on a successful save, targets take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks for the duration of the spell. This spell draws inspiration from the emotional manipulation magic seen in Elder Scrolls' Illusion school.

Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state until a heal, limited wish, miracle, or wish spell is used to cancel the effect of the feeblemind. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a –4 penalty on its saving throw.

- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** Mind fog produces a bank of thin mist that weakens the mental resistance of those caught in it. Creatures in the mind fog take a –10 penalty on Wisdom checks and Will saves. (A creature that successfully saves against the fog is not affected and need not make further saves even if it remains in the fog.) Affected creatures take the penalty as long as they remain in the fog and for 2d6 rounds thereafter. The fog is stationary and lasts for 30 minutes (or until dispersed by wind).

- **Description:** This spell functions like symbol of death, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the symbol of sleep instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 × 10 minutes. Unlike with the sleep spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires. Unlike symbol of death, symbol of sleep has no hit point limit; once triggered, a symbol of sleep simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. Note: Magic traps such as symbol of sleep are hard to detect and disable. A rogue (only) can use the Perception skill to find a symbol of sleep and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for symbol of sleep.

### 7. Dominate Animal, Greater

Even creatures that save against the spell are shaken for 1 round and take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, ability checks, and skill checks for the duration of the spell.

The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place.

The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn.

While this spell is in effect, you can force the subject to perform any action you desire, even actions that would result in the subject's death. The subject uses its own physical abilities but is under your mental control. You need not see the subject to control it, but you must maintain concentration to keep control of the subject. If the subject is out of range or if your concentration is broken, the subject reverts to its normal behavior but still cannot remember what happened while it was under your control. This powerful spell draws inspiration from the master-level Illusion spells of Elder Scrolls and the high-level enchanter abilities from EverQuest.

While using the subject's senses, you are blinded and deafened with respect to your own surroundings. You can mentally command the subject (a free action) to take actions and can force it to perform actions against its nature by making an opposed Charisma check. If you win, the subject performs the action but takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until it is no longer forced to act against its nature.

## Level 8 Enchantment Spells

### 1. Antipathy
- **School:** Enchantment [Compulsion] [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 1 Hour
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lump of alum soaked in vinegar)
- **Duration:** 2 hours/level (D)
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One location (up to a 10-ft. cube/level) or one object
- **Saving Throw:** Will partial
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that repel either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be repelled must be named. Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel an urge to leave the area or to avoid the affected item. A compulsion forces them to abandon the area or item, shunning it and never willingly returning to it while the spell is in effect. A creature that makes a successful saving throw can stay in the area or touch the item but feels uncomfortable doing so. This distracting discomfort reduces the creature's Dexterity score by 4 points.

### 2. Binding
- **School:** Enchantment [Compulsion] [Mind-Affecting]
- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 1 Minute
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

- **Duration:** See text (D)
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One living creature
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** A binding spell creates a magical restraint to hold a creature. The target gets an initial saving throw only if its Hit Dice equal at least half your caster level. You may have as many as six assistants help you with the spell. For each assistant who casts suggestion, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by 1. For each assistant who casts dominate animal, dominate person, or dominate monster, your caster level for this casting of binding increases by a number equal to one-third of that assistant's level, provided that the spell's target is appropriate for a binding spell. Since the assistants' spells are cast simply to improve your caster level for the purpose of the binding spell, saving throws and spell resistance against the assistants' spells are irrelevant. Your caster level determines whether the target gets an initial Will saving throw and how long the binding lasts. All binding spells are dismissible.

### 3. Charm Monster, Mass

- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

If there are more potential targets than you can affect, you choose them one at a time until you choose a creature with too many HD or reach the spell's maximum number of subjects.

- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** This spell functions like sending, but the message can also contain a suggestion (see the suggestion spell), which the subject does its best to carry out. A successful Will save negates the suggestion effect but not the contact itself. The demand, if received, is understood even if the subject's Intelligence score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the demand is issued, the message is understood but the suggestion is ineffective.

### 5. Irresistible Dance, Mass

- **Target/Area of Effect:** One location (up to a 10-ft. cube/level) or one object
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates; see text
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You cause an object or location to emanate magical vibrations that attract either a specific kind of intelligent creature or creatures of a particular alignment, as defined by you. The kind of creature to be affected must be named specifically. A creature subtype is not specific enough. Likewise, the specific alignment to be attracted must be named. Creatures of the designated kind or alignment feel elated and pleased to be in the area or desire to touch or possess the object. The compulsion to stay in the area or touch the object is overpowering. If the save is successful, the creature is released from the enchantment, but a subsequent save must be made 1d6 × 10 minutes later. If this save fails, the affected creature attempts to return to the area or object.

### 8. Mind Blank, Reciprocal

- **Duration:** 24 hours
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One creature
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** This spell functions like mind blank, except that instead of protecting the target from mental intrusion, it makes the target completely unable to use any mind-affecting spells or abilities, unable to cast any divination spells, and unable to use any divination magic items or abilities. The target takes a -4 penalty on Will saves and cannot benefit from any insight bonuses. This powerful spell draws inspiration from the master-level Illusion magic of Elder Scrolls and the high-level enchanter abilities from EverQuest.

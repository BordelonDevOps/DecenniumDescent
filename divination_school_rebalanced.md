Once the spell has been cast upon the subjects, the distance between them and the caster does not affect the spell as long as they are on the same plane of existence.

Therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth.

- **Target/Area of Effect:** You
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns aura location and power more quickly. You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level. You can also determine the school of magic involved in each aura, though this requires a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + spell level) for each aura.

- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** Clairaudience/clairvoyance creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don't need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale must be known—a place familiar to you, or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn't move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it.

### 3. Speak with Dead

The corpse's knowledge is limited to what it knew during life, including the languages it spoke. Answers are brief, cryptic, or repetitive, especially if the creature would have opposed you in life. If the dead creature's alignment was different from yours, the corpse gets a Will save to resist the spell. A corpse that has been subject to speak with dead in the past 24 hours can't be affected again.

In addition, the target's damage reduction (if any) is reduced by 5 against your attacks (minimum 0). If the target has multiple types of damage reduction, all of them are reduced.

### 6. Seek Thoughts

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject. 1st Round: Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with Intelligence scores of 1 or higher). 2nd Round: Number of thinking minds and the Intelligence score of each. If the highest Intelligence is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own Intelligence score), you are stunned for 1 round and the spell ends. 3rd Round: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's Will save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast seek thoughts again to have another chance. Unlike detect thoughts, this spell can detect the thoughts of creatures protected by mind blank or similar effects, though such creatures get a +10 bonus on their Will saves.

### 7. Scrying
- **School:** Divination [Scrying]
- **Level:** 3
- **Casting Time:** 1 Hour
- **Range:** See text

- **Duration:** 1 minute/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** Magical sensor
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** You can observe a creature at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the spell fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well your knowledge of the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. If the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save. Scrying creates an invisible magical sensor that sends you information. You can see and hear the subject and its surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject).

- **Level:** 3
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

If the scrying attempt originates within the area, you also know its location; otherwise, you and the scrier immediately make opposed caster level checks (1d20 + caster level).

The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If your party doesn't act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful.

To find a kind of creature, you must have seen such a creature up close (within 30 feet) at least once. Running water blocks the spell. It cannot detect objects. It can be fooled by mislead, nondetection, and polymorph spells.

## Level 5 Divination Spells

### 1. Contact Other Plane
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Personal
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration
- **Target/Area of Effect:** You
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** You send your mind to another plane of existence (an Elemental Plane or some plane farther removed) in order to receive advice and information from powers there. The powers reply in a language you understand, but they resent such contact and give only brief answers to your questions. All questions are answered with "yes," "no," "maybe," "never," "irrelevant," or some other one-word answer. You must concentrate on maintaining the spell in order to ask questions at the rate of one per round. A question is answered by the power during the same round. You may ask one question for every two caster levels. Contact with minds far removed from your home plane increases the probability that you will incur a decrease in Intelligence and Charisma due to your brain being overwhelmed, but also increases the chance of the power knowing the answer and answering correctly.

### 2. Prying Eyes
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 Minute
- **Range:** 1 mile
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of crystal marbles)

- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** You create a number of semitangible, visible magical orbs (called "eyes") equal to 1d4 + your caster level. These eyes move out, scout around, and return as you direct them when casting the spell. Each eye can see 120 feet (normal vision only) in all directions. While the individual eyes are quite fragile, they're small and difficult to spot. Each eye is a Fine construct, about the size of a small apple, that has 1 hit point, AC 18 (+8 bonus for its size), flies at a speed of 30 feet with perfect maneuverability, and has a +16 Hide modifier. It has a Spot modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings.

### 3. Telepathic Bond
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

### 4. Legend Lore
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 5

- **Duration:** See text
- **Target/Area of Effect:** You
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** Legend lore brings to your mind legends about an important person, place, or thing. If the person or thing is at hand, or if you are in the place in question, the casting time is only 1d4 × 10 minutes. If you have only detailed information on the person, place, or thing, the casting time is 1d10 days, and the resulting lore is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or thing, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time). If you know only rumors, the casting time is 2d6 weeks, and the resulting lore is vague and incomplete (though it often directs you to more detailed information, thus allowing a better legend lore result next time).

### 5. Find the Path
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 3 rounds
- **Range:** Personal or touch
- **Components:** V, S, F (a set of divination counters)

The location must be on the same plane as you are at the time of casting. The spell enables the subject to sense the correct direction that will eventually lead it to its destination, indicating at appropriate times the exact path to follow or physical actions to take.

- **Saving Throw:** None

You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are correct within the limits of the entity's knowledge. "Unclear" is a legitimate answer, because powerful beings of the Outer Planes are not necessarily omniscient. In cases where a one-word answer would be misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, a short phrase (five words or less) might be given as an answer instead.

### 7. Analyze Dweomer
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

Each round, you may examine a single creature or object that you can see as a standard action. In the case of a magic item, you learn its functions (including any curse effects), how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if it uses charges). In the case of an object or creature with active spells cast upon it, you learn each spell, its effect, and its caster level. An attended object may attempt a Will save to resist this effect if its holder so desires. If the save succeeds, you learn nothing about the object except what you can discern by looking at it.

### 8. Foresight, Lesser
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 5
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Personal or touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a hummingbird's feather)

- **Description:** This spell grants you a powerful sixth sense in relation to yourself or another. Once foresight is cast, you receive instantaneous warnings of impending danger or harm to the subject of the spell. You are never surprised or flat-footed. In addition, the spell gives you a general idea of what action you might take to best protect yourself and gives you a +2 insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves. This insight bonus is lost whenever you would lose a Dexterity bonus to AC. When another creature is the subject of the spell, you receive warnings about that creature. You must communicate what you learn to the other creature for the warning to be useful, and the creature can be caught unprepared in the absence of such a warning.

Subjects who do not wish to be probed can attempt to move beyond the spell's range, unless somehow hindered.

If the person or object is at hand or if you are in the place in question, you receive a vision about it by succeeding on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 20. If only detailed information on the person, place, or object is known, the DC is 25, and the information gained is less complete and specific (though it often provides enough information to help you find the person, place, or object, thus allowing a better vision result next time).

The first time during the spell's duration that the subject would be affected by such an event, the spell automatically activates, allowing the subject to completely avoid the effect.

- **Description:** A discern location spell is among the most powerful means of locating creatures or objects. Nothing short of a mind blank spell or the direct intervention of a deity keeps you from learning the exact location of a single individual or object. Discern location circumvents normal means of protection from scrying or location. The spell reveals the name of the creature or object's location (place, name, business name, building name, or the like), community, county (or similar political division), country, continent, and the plane of existence where the target lies.

You can also apply the insight bonus to your AC against a single attack. You can use the spell's effect a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).

- **Description:** You gain a brief glimpse of the future, allowing you to predict the outcome of a specific course of action. You must describe a specific action or sequence of actions that you or others might take, and the spell reveals the most likely outcome if those actions are taken. The prediction takes the form of a brief vision that only you can see, showing the most probable result of the described actions. The prediction is accurate to the best of the universe's knowledge, but it cannot account for the direct intervention of deities or other powerful forces that might alter fate. The spell cannot predict events more than one day into the future.

### 6. Commune with Greater Powers

- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes

- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** You
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** This spell functions like commune, except you contact a more powerful entity, such as a demigod, archon, or similar being of great power. You are allowed one such question per caster level. The answers given are more detailed than those provided by commune, with each answer being up to twenty words long. The entity contacted has a 95% chance of knowing the answer to your questions, and it will always answer truthfully to the best of its knowledge.

### 7. Fate Vision
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 1 Minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a mirror made of polished silver worth at least 1,000 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One creature
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
- **Description:** You glimpse the target's fate, seeing a vision of the most significant event that will occur in the target's life within the next year. The vision is vivid and detailed, showing the circumstances, location, and other individuals involved in the event. The vision might show a moment of great triumph, terrible tragedy, or profound transformation. The spell does not reveal when exactly the event will occur, only that it will happen within the next year if the target's current course remains unchanged. The target also sees this vision and gains the same knowledge you do. Both you and the target gain a +4 insight bonus on any skill checks or saving throws directly related to preparing for or responding to the foreseen event.

### 8. Planar Eye
- **School:** Divination [Scrying]
- **Level:** 8
- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** See text
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 1,000 gp)
- **Duration:** 1 minute/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** Magical sensor
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** This spell creates an invisible magical sensor similar to that created by arcane eye, except that it can travel to other planes of existence. You must know the proper planar coordinates for the destination plane. The planar eye moves at a rate of 30 feet per round and can see and hear as if you were present at its location. It can travel through the air or through solid material at your direction. The eye can travel to any location on the target plane, and you need not have seen the location before. The eye can be detected by spells that detect scrying sensors, such as detect scrying. You can cast spells through the planar eye as if you were present at its location, though doing so ends the spell immediately after the spell is cast.

## Level 9 Divination Spells

### 1. Foresight, Greater
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 9
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Personal or touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a hummingbird's feather)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** See text
- **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** No or Yes (harmless)
- **Description:** This spell functions like foresight, except the insight bonus to AC and Reflex saves increases to +5, and the insight bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls (if you are the subject) increases to +5. In addition, if you are the subject of the spell, you can use an immediate action once per round to completely avoid a single attack or harmful effect, as if you had the evasion and improved evasion abilities. This avoidance ability can be used against any attack or harmful effect, even those that normally do not allow a saving throw or that would normally affect you even if you succeeded on a saving throw.

### 2. Mind Blank, Greater
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 9
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 24 hours
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
- **Description:** This spell functions like mind blank, except it affects multiple creatures and provides even greater protection. The subjects are protected from all devices and spells that gather information about them through divination magic. This spell also grants a +10 resistance bonus on saving throws against all mind-affecting spells and effects. Greater mind blank even foils limited wish, miracle, and wish spells when they are used in such a way as to gain information about the subjects. In the case of scrying that scans an area the subjects are in, such as arcane eye, the spell works but the subjects simply aren't detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subjects do not work at all.

### 3. Astral Projection, Greater
- **School:** Divination [Astral]
- **Level:** 9
- **Casting Time:** 30 minutes
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp, plus a silver bar worth 5 gp for each person to be affected)
- **Duration:** See text
- **Target/Area of Effect:** You plus one additional willing creature touched per two caster levels
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes
- **Description:** This spell functions like astral projection, except you and your companions can travel to any plane, not just the Astral Plane. You need not have any special knowledge of the destination plane, and there is no chance of becoming lost. You and your companions appear exactly where you wish to on the destination plane. In addition, your astral forms are more substantial and resilient. Each traveler gains temporary hit points equal to 2d10 + your caster level (maximum +25) while in astral form, and each traveler can cast spells as if they were on their home plane, with no chance of spell failure due to planar differences.

### 4. Fate Alteration
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 9
- **Casting Time:** 1 Minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth at least 5,000 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Target/Area of Effect:** One creature
- **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
- **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
- **Description:** You alter a creature's fate, changing the course of a single predestined event in its future. When you cast this spell, you must describe a specific event that you believe is fated to occur to the target. If such an event is indeed in the target's future (within the next year), you receive a vision confirming this, and the spell takes effect, altering probability and circumstance to prevent that event from occurring. If no such event is fated to occur, you receive a vision showing this, and the spell has no effect. The spell cannot prevent events that are absolutely certain to occur, such as natural death from old age, nor can it prevent events directly caused by deities or similarly powerful beings. However, it can prevent most other fated events, such as death by specific means, capture by specific enemies, or other significant negative occurrences.

### 5. Cosmic Awareness
- **School:** Divination
- **Level:** 9
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round/level
- **Target/Area of Effect:** You
- **Saving Throw:** None
- **Spell Resistance:** No
- **Description:** You attain a state of cosmic awareness, perceiving all things in your vicinity with perfect clarity. You can see, hear, smell, taste, and feel everything within 100 feet of you, regardless of barriers or line of sight. You automatically detect invisible, ethereal, and hidden creatures and objects. You can see through all illusions and disguises. You automatically succeed on all Perception checks within this range. You can perceive the thoughts and emotions of all creatures within range as if using detect thoughts, except no saving throw is allowed. You can determine the exact properties and functions of any magic item or magical effect within range. You can sense the presence of portals, dimensional anomalies, and planar connections within range. This heightened awareness grants you a +10 insight bonus on initiative checks and a +10 insight bonus on all saving throws.

When you cast a divination spell of 8th level or lower during the duration of divination mastery, you can apply any one of the following effects to that spell: cast it as if it were prepared with the Extend Spell metamagic feat without increasing its level; cast it without expending a prepared spell or spell slot; cast it as if your caster level were 5 higher for determining its effects; or cast it with immunity to counterspelling attempts. You can use this ability once per three caster levels (minimum once).

The spell provides only factual information, not predictions of the future or subjective judgments. The spell cannot reveal information about events that are magically obscured, such as those protected by mind blank or similar effects. The knowledge granted by this spell is precise and detailed but limited to observable facts; it does not grant insight into motivations, emotions, or other subjective aspects of events.

### 8. Divine Insight

- **Level:** 9
- **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
- **Range:** Personal
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gem worth at least 5,000 gp)

You can see and hear anything occurring within 1 mile per caster level as if you were present at that location, focusing your perception as a standard action. You automatically know if anyone within this range is attempting to scry on you or gather information about you through magical means. You gain a +10 insight bonus on all skill checks and ability checks. Once per round as a free action, you can act with perfect insight, automatically succeeding on a single attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check, or forcing an opponent to reroll a successful attack or saving throw against you. This spell represents the height of divinatory power, granting knowledge and foresight that approaches that of demigods.

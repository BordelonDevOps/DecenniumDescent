# Decennium Descent - Universal School Spells (Expanded)

This document presents a comprehensive draft of spells for the Universal school of magic in Decennium Descent, expanding upon the user-provided framework. These spells focus on raw magical manipulation, spell enhancement, teleportation, time distortion, and planar lawbreaking, often crossing traditional school boundaries to augment or reshape magic itself.

## Level 0 Universal Spells (Cantrips)

### 1. Prestidigitation
*   **School:** Universal
*   **Level:** 0
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** 1 hour
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** See text
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** Prestidigitations are minor magical tricks. Once cast, a prestidigitation spell enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. You can create one of the following effects at a time: slowly lift 1 pound of material; color, clean, or soil items in a 1-foot cube each round; chill, warm, or flavor 1 pound of nonliving material; create a harmless sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor. Prestidigitations cannot deal damage or disrupt the concentration of spellcasters. This spell can create small objects, but they look crude and artificial and are easily recognized as magical. Any actual change to an object (beyond just moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists only for 1 hour.

### 2. Mage Light
*   **School:** Universal [Light]
*   **Level:** 0
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, M (a bit of phosphorus)
*   **Duration:** 1 hour/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Object touched
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You touch an object, causing it to glow like a torch. It sheds normal light in a 20-foot radius, and increases the light level by one step for an additional 20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light, and dim light becomes normal light). The effect is immobile, but it can be cast on a movable object. Mage Light taken into an area of magical darkness does not function.

### 3. Arcane Tether
*   **School:** Universal [Divination]
*   **Level:** 0
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One object or willing creature touched
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless, object/creature)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You create a faint arcane link between yourself and a target object or willing creature. For the duration, you have a vague sense of the target’s direction and general distance from you (e.g., “north, very far,” or “nearby, below”). The tether provides no information about the target’s condition or surroundings. If the target moves to another plane, the tether is broken.

### 4. Glyph Trace
*   **School:** Universal [Divination]
*   **Level:** 0
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 min./level
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One object or 5-ft. square area
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You cause any magical runes, sigils, glyphs, or similar magical writings to faintly glow, becoming more visible. This spell gives you a +5 circumstance bonus on Perception checks made to find magical traps or writings. It does not decipher the writings, only makes them easier to spot.

### 5. Momentary Pause
*   **School:** Universal [Transmutation]
*   **Level:** 0
*   **Casting Time:** See text (often a Free Action before initiative is rolled)
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** S
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You briefly attune yourself to the flow of combat. If you and one or more other creatures roll the same initiative result, you act before them. This spell is typically cast as a free action immediately before initiative is rolled, or as part of the initiative roll itself if allowed by the GM.

### 6. Spectral Quill
*   **School:** Universal [Creation]
*   **Level:** 0
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 min./level
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One surface
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You conjure a quill made of faint, glowing energy that writes or draws on a designated surface at your mental command. The writing is clear and precise, in any color you choose. You can write at a normal pace. The writing is non-magical and can be erased or washed away normally once the spell ends.

### 7. Cantrip Echo
*   **School:** Universal
*   **Level:** 0
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Swift Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** Immediately after casting a cantrip with a casting time of 1 standard action, you can use this spell as a swift action to cast that same cantrip again. The second casting still requires any components the original cantrip had.

### 8. Magical Ping
*   **School:** Universal [Divination]
*   **Level:** 0
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** 10-ft.-radius burst centered on you
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You send out a subtle pulse of arcane energy. For a brief moment, you become aware of the number and general location (but not the nature or strength) of any active magical effects or items within a 10-foot radius burst centered on you. This does not detect creatures, only their magical auras if they are currently under the effect of a spell or are inherently magical.

## Level 1 Universal Spells

### 1. Spellshift
*   **School:** Universal [Metamagic]
*   **Level:** 1
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Swift Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V
*   **Duration:** Until the end of your next turn
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** The next spell you cast
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** When you cast this spell, you can alter the energy type of the next spell you cast before the end of your next turn that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage. The altered spell works normally in all respects except that its damage type changes to another one from that list (your choice). For example, a *fireball* could be shifted to deal cold damage. This cannot be used on spells that do not deal energy damage.

### 2. Arcane Lock
*   **School:** Universal [Abjuration]
*   **Level:** 1
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth 25 gp)
*   **Duration:** Permanent
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One door, chest, or other object with a lock or latch
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** An *arcane lock* spell magically locks a door, chest, or similar object. You can freely pass your own lock without affecting it. Otherwise, a creature trying to open an arcane locked portal or object must succeed on a Strength check (DC 20 + your caster level) or a Thievery check (DC 30 + your caster level) to do so. A *knock* spell or a successful *dispel magic* can bypass or remove the lock. Add 10 to the normal DC to break open a door or object affected by this spell.

### 3. Ritual Anchor
*   **School:** Universal
*   **Level:** 1
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a silver pin and incense worth 10 gp)
*   **Duration:** 24 hours
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One location (up to a 10-ft. cube)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You create an arcane anchor point at a specific location. For the next 24 hours, if you are performing a ritual that normally requires you to be at a specific location (e.g., a sacred circle, a specific altar), you can instead perform that ritual from any distance, provided you can see the anchored location (perhaps via scrying or another divination). The ritual’s effects manifest at the anchored location. This spell does not reduce ritual casting times or component costs.

### 4. Mana Tether
*   **School:** Universal
*   **Level:** 1
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Two willing spellcasters
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You create a conduit of magical energy between two willing spellcasters (one of whom can be yourself). For the duration, one caster (the 

sender") can choose to cast a spell they know, and the other caster (the "receiver") can deliver that spell as if they had cast it, using the receiver's location and actions, but the sender's spell slot and casting statistics (caster level, save DCs). The receiver must have line of sight and effect to the target. Both casters must be willing and able to cast spells.

### 5. Delay Spell
*   **School:** Universal [Metamagic]
*   **Level:** 1
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Swift Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V
*   **Duration:** Until the end of your next turn (see text)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** The next spell you cast
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** When you cast this spell, the next spell you cast with a casting time of 1 standard action or less is delayed. Instead of taking effect immediately, it takes effect at a point you designate within the next 6 seconds (typically at the start of your next turn, or just before or after another creature's action, if you specify). You must still concentrate on the delayed spell if it requires concentration. If your concentration is broken before the delayed spell takes effect, it is lost.

### 6. Flare Sigil
*   **School:** Universal
*   **Level:** 1
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature or object
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object/creature if unwilling)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You place a faint, shimmering sigil on a target. The sigil is nearly invisible until the next time the target is affected by a spell you cast. When that occurs, the sigil flares brightly, and the spell affecting the target has a +1 bonus to its caster level for determining its effects (such as range, duration, damage, or overcoming spell resistance). The sigil then disappears. Only one flare sigil can be on a target at a time.

### 7. Magic Thread
*   **School:** Universal
*   **Level:** 1
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of silken thread)
*   **Duration:** 1 hour/level or until discharged
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One object or willing creature touched
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You imbue an object or willing creature with a minor magical effect that is triggered by a specific condition you set (e.g., a spoken word, a touch from a specific person, opening a container). The effect must be a cantrip you know. When the trigger condition occurs, the cantrip effect manifests as if you had cast it. The magic thread then dissipates. You can only have one magic thread active at a time.

### 8. Quick Cast
*   **School:** Universal [Metamagic]
*   **Level:** 1
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Swift Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** The next spell you cast this turn
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You can cast your next spell this turn that has a casting time of 1 standard action as a bonus action instead. This spell uses up your swift action for the turn. You can only use Quick Cast once per round. This does not affect spells with longer casting times.

### 1. Arcane Portal
*   **School:** Universal [Conjuration/Teleportation]
*   **Level:** 2
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Two points in space
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No

Any creature can step through the portal to instantly appear at the other connected point. The portal is two-way. It closes when the duration expires or if you dismiss it as a standard action.

### 2. Spell Mirror
*   **School:** Universal [Abjuration]
*   **Level:** 2
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Immediate Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** S
*   **Duration:** Until the start of your next turn
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** See text
*   **Description:** You swiftly create a shimmering field of arcane energy around yourself. The next spell of 2nd level or lower that targets only you and allows spell resistance is redirected back at its original caster. The original caster becomes the target of the spell, using their own save DCs and caster level. If the spell cannot target the original caster (e.g., a spell that only affects humanoids cast by a non-humanoid), it is simply negated. This spell does not affect area effect spells or spells that do not allow spell resistance.

### 3. Thread Tap
*   **School:** Universal [Divination]
*   **Level:** 2
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S, F (a small silver mirror)
*   **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 min./level
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One ongoing spell effect
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You attempt to tap into the magical energies of an ongoing spell effect that you can perceive. If successful, you gain basic information about it each round you concentrate: its school of magic, the caster’s approximate caster level (within a range of 3, e.g., “caster level 5th-7th”), and a general sense of its remaining duration (e.g., “short,” “moderate,” “long”). You do not learn the exact spell name or its precise parameters.

### 4. Echo Cast
*   **School:** Universal [Metamagic]
*   **Level:** 2
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Swift Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** The next spell of 1st level or lower you cast this turn
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** After casting a spell of 1st level or lower with a casting time of 1 standard action, you can use this spell as a swift action to immediately cast that same spell again without expending an additional spell slot. The second casting still requires any components the original spell had. You can only use Echo Cast once per round.

### 5. Identify
*   **School:** Universal [Divination]
*   **Level:** 2
*   **Casting Time:** 1 hour
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a pearl of at least 100 gp value, wine, and an owl feather)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One magic item touched
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** The spell determines all magic properties of a single magic item, including its functions, how to activate its functions (if appropriate), and how many charges are left (if it uses charges). If the item is a cursed item, you have a 10% chance per caster level of determining that it is cursed (though not the nature of the curse). If the item has multiple abilities, you learn about one ability per 2 caster levels (minimum 1).

### 6. Levitate
*   **School:** Universal [Transmutation]
*   **Level:** 2
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal or Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You or one willing creature or one object (total weight up to 100 lbs./level)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You or a target creature or object can be made to float up or down as you wish. The target can be levitated up to 20 feet per round. A levitating creature can move horizontally by pushing or pulling along a surface or by other means. It cannot move itself horizontally if there is nothing to push off of. The target can be moved vertically as a move action by the caster.

*   **Components:** S
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** As an immediate action, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

### 2. Unravel Spell (Dispel Magic)
*   **School:** Universal [Abjuration]
*   **Level:** 3
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One spellcaster, creature, or object
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You can use *unravel spell* to end one ongoing spell that has been cast on a creature or object, to temporarily suppress the magical abilities of a magic item, or to counter another spellcaster’s spell. A targeted dispel check is 1d20 + your caster level (maximum +10) against a DC of 11 + the spell’s caster level. If you target a creature or object that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by *summon monster*), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the creature. If you target a magic item, you make a dispel check; if successful, the item’s magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds.

### 3. Spatial Fold
*   **School:** Universal [Conjuration/Teleportation]
*   **Level:** 3
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Move Action

*   **Casting Time:** 1 Immediate Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level or until discharged (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** As an immediate action when you would take damage, you can sacrifice a prepared spell or an unused spell slot to create a shield of raw magical energy. The shield grants you temporary hit points equal to 5 times the level of the spell slot sacrificed (e.g., sacrificing a 2nd-level slot grants 10 temporary HP). These temporary HP last for the duration of the *mana shield* spell or until they are depleted. You can cast this spell multiple times, but temporary HP from this spell do not stack; only the highest amount applies.

### 5. Tongues
*   **School:** Universal [Divination]
*   **Level:** 3
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)

*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Creature touched
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
*   **Description:** This spell grants the creature touched the ability to speak and understand the language of any intelligent creature, whether it is a racial tongue or a regional dialect. The subject can speak only one language at a time, although it may be able to understand several languages. *Tongues* does not enable the subject to speak with creatures who don’t speak. The subject can make itself understood as far as its voice carries. This spell does not predispose any creature addressed toward the subject in any way.

### 6. Haste (Universal Variant)
*   **School:** Universal [Transmutation]
*   **Level:** 3
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
*   **Description:** The transmuted creatures move and act incredibly quickly. Each affected creature gains an additional move action each round. This additional move action can be used to move, draw a weapon, or perform other move actions, but not to make an attack or cast a spell. All affected creatures also gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls, a +1 dodge bonus to AC and Reflex saves, and their speeds are increased by 30 feet (to a maximum of twice the subject’s normal speed for that movement type). Multiple haste effects don’t stack. When the spell ends, the creatures are fatigued for 1 minute.

## Level 4 Universal Spells

### 1. Spell Theft
*   **School:** Universal
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (see text)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You attempt to steal an ongoing spell effect of 3rd level or lower from a target creature. If the target fails a Will save, one beneficial spell effect of your choice currently affecting it ends for the target and is transferred to you for the remainder of its original duration, or for this spell’s duration, whichever is shorter. You gain the benefits of the spell as if it had been cast on you. This cannot steal instantaneous spells or spells with a range of personal (unless they were cast on the target by another). If the stolen spell requires concentration, you must concentrate to maintain it.

### 2. Time Skip
*   **School:** Universal [Teleportation, Time]
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** See text
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You vanish from the current timeline for a brief moment. You disappear and then reappear at the start of your next turn in the same space you left (or the nearest unoccupied space if it is occupied). To all other creatures, you seem to vanish for an entire round. When you reappear, you can immediately take a surprise bonus action (such as casting a quickened spell or making a single attack) before your normal turn begins. You are effectively removed from play for the intervening round and cannot be targeted or affected by anything.

### 3. Arcane Reversal
*   **School:** Universal
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a small, cracked mirror)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One ongoing spell effect
*   **Saving Throw:** None (see text)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You attempt to reverse the fundamental nature of an ongoing spell effect of 3rd level or lower. For example, a *cure light wounds* effect could be reversed to deal damage instead of healing, a *haste* effect could become a *slow* effect, or a *light* spell could become *darkness*. The reversed spell uses its original caster level and save DCs, but its effects are inverted. This requires a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) against a DC of 11 + the original spell’s caster level. This cannot reverse instantaneous spells or spells that do not have a clear opposite effect.

### 4. Mystic Gate (Dimension Door)
*   **School:** Universal [Conjuration/Teleportation]
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You and touched objects or other willing creatures
*   **Saving Throw:** None and Will negates (object or creature)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No and Yes (object or creature)
*   **Description:** You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to any other spot within range. You always arrive at exactly the spot desired—whether by simply visualizing the area or by stating direction. After using this spell, you can’t take any other actions until your next turn. You may bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You may also bring one additional willing Medium or smaller creature (carrying gear or objects up to its maximum load) or its equivalent per three caster levels. A Large creature counts as two Medium creatures, a Huge creature counts as two Large creatures, and so forth. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

### 5. Resilient Sphere
*   **School:** Universal [Evocation/Force]
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature or object (up to a 1-ft. diameter/level)
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature or object, provided it fits within the sphere’s diameter. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a *disintegrate* spell, a *rod of cancellation*, a *sphere of annihilation*, or a *mage’s disjunction* spell. The sphere resists any attempt to dispel it as if its caster were 10 levels higher. The creature or object within is safe from all attacks, but can also not attack or affect anything outside the sphere. The sphere is buoyant and can float on water.

### 6. Scrying
*   **School:** Universal [Divination]
*   **Level:** 4
*   **Casting Time:** 1 hour
*   **Range:** See text
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a silver mirror worth 1,000 gp), F (a font of water)
*   **Duration:** 1 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You can see and hear some creature, who may be at any distance. If the subject succeeds on a Will save, the scrying attempt fails. The difficulty of the save depends on how well you know the subject and what sort of physical connection (if any) you have to that creature. Furthermore, if the subject is on another plane, it gets a +5 bonus on its Will save. If the save fails, you can see and hear the subject and its immediate surroundings (approximately 10 feet in all directions of the subject). If the subject moves, the sensor follows at a speed of up to 150 feet. The spell creates an invisible magical sensor that you can use to view the subject.

### 1. Planar Gate (Plane Shift)
*   **School:** Universal [Conjuration/Teleportation]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, S, F (a forked metal rod attuned to the desired plane, worth 250 gp)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You and touched willing creatures (up to eight)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If you are touching other creatures when you cast the spell, they may accompany you (to a maximum of eight creatures, including yourself). If you are uncertain of the precise location on the destination plane, you appear in a random, safe location. You can also use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane (treat as a ranged touch attack, Will save negates). When used in this way, the creature is sent to a random location on a plane of your choice, and you cannot accompany them.

### 2. Quicken Cast
*   **School:** Universal [Metamagic]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Free Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One spell of 4th level or lower
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** This spell allows you to cast another spell of 4th level or lower as a free action. The spell to be quickened must have a casting time of 1 standard action or less. You can only use Quicken Cast once per round. Using this spell does not affect your ability to cast other spells during the round (subject to normal limits on actions).

### 3. Spell Seal
*   **School:** Universal [Abjuration]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of sovereign glue)
*   **Duration:** Permanent until broken (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One ongoing spell effect of 4th level or lower
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You reinforce an ongoing spell effect of 4th level or lower, making it highly resistant to being dispelled. The DC to dispel the sealed spell increases by +10. Additionally, the sealed spell cannot be ended by effects that would normally suppress or temporarily negate it (though it can still be dispelled if the dispel check is successful against the higher DC). You can dismiss your own *spell seal* as a standard action.

### 4. Dimensional Shift (Teleport)
*   **School:** Universal [Conjuration/Teleportation]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal or Touch
*   **Components:** V
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You and touched objects or other willing creatures (up to one additional creature per two caster levels)
*   **Saving Throw:** None and Will negates (object or creature)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No and Yes (object or creature)
*   **Description:** This spell instantly transports you or a touched willing creature to a designated destination. The destination can be chosen in one of three ways: a known location, a described location, or a sequence of landmarks. Distance is not a factor, but interplanar travel is not possible. You (and any creatures or objects brought along) appear at the desired spot. If the destination is hazardous or occupied, you arrive in the nearest safe, unoccupied space. After using this spell, you can’t take any other actions until your next turn.

### 5. Fabricate
*   **School:** Universal [Transmutation/Creation]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** See text
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Raw materials (up to 10 cubic feet/level)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You convert raw materials into finished items of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a cloth gown from a pile of wool, or a stone statue from a rock. The quality of items made by this spell is commensurate with the quality of material used as a component for the spell. The casting time depends on the volume of material and complexity of the item, typically 1 round per 10 cubic feet of material for simple items, or 1 minute per cubic foot for complex items. You must make an appropriate Craft check to make complex items.

### 6. Telekinesis
*   **School:** Universal [Transmutation]
*   **Level:** 5
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object or unwilling creature) or None (see text)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object or unwilling creature)
*   **Description:** You can move objects or creatures by concentrating. Depending on the version selected, the spell can provide a gentle, sustained force or a single short, violent thrust. Sustained force allows you to move one object or creature up to 20 feet per round. A creature can negate this effect on itself or an object it holds with a successful Will save or by overpowering your telekinetic force with a Strength check. Violent thrust allows you to hurl one object or creature a short distance, dealing damage (1d6 per 25 pounds of the object, or 1d6 for a creature if hurled against a solid surface).

*   **Duration:** 1 round (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You attempt to briefly lock a creature outside the normal flow of time. If the target fails a Will save, it is frozen in time for 1 round. While chrono locked, the creature is invulnerable, cannot act or be affected by anything, and is unaware of its surroundings. At the end of the duration, it resumes its place in the initiative order as if no time had passed for it. This spell cannot affect creatures immune to time-based effects.

### 2. Rift Spiral
*   **School:** Universal [Conjuration, Force]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S, F (a twisted piece of metal)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** 20-ft.-radius burst
*   **Saving Throw:** Reflex half (damage); Fortitude negates (slow/prone)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You create a violent, spiraling rift in reality. Creatures in the area take 6d6 points of force damage (Reflex save for half). Additionally, creatures that fail a Fortitude save are either slowed (as the *slow* spell) for 1d4 rounds or knocked prone (50% chance of each). The area is filled with distorted space and is considered difficult terrain for 1 minute.

### 3. Arcane Clone (Mislead)
*   **School:** Universal [Illusion]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** S
*   **Duration:** 1 round/level (D) and concentration + 3 rounds (see text)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** Will disbelieves (if interacted with)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You become invisible (as *greater invisibility*) and simultaneously create an illusory double of yourself. The double appears within range and lasts for the duration of the spell. You can move the double as a free action on your turn. The double can talk and gesture as if it were you, but it cannot attack or cast spells. If the double is struck by an attack, it dissipates, but the invisibility on you persists for its full duration (concentration + 3 rounds). You can see and hear through the double’s senses if you concentrate.

### 4. Spell Sculptor (Contingency)
*   **School:** Universal [Evocation]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** Personal or Touch (for companion spell)
*   **Components:** V, S, M (quicksilver, an eyelash from a hare, and a gem worth at least 1,500 gp), F (ivory statuette of you or the target, 1,500 gp)
*   **Duration:** 1 day/level or until discharged (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You (or touched creature for companion spell)
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You can place another spell upon your person or an item so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting *contingency*. The *contingency* spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The companion spell must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level). The condition needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although it can be general. For example, a *contingency* could be set to cast *fly* on you if you fall more than 10 feet. The companion spell occurs instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (contingency and the companion magic) may fail.

### 5. Antimagic Field
*   **School:** Universal [Abjuration]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** 10-ft. radius emanation centered on you
*   **Components:** V, S, M/DF (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)
*   **Duration:** 10 min./level (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** 10-ft.-radius emanation
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** See text
*   **Description:** An invisible barrier surrounds you and moves with you. The space within this barrier is impervious to most magical effects, including spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. Likewise, it prevents the functioning of any magic items or spells within its confines. An *antimagic field* suppresses any spell or magical effect used within, brought into, or cast into the area, but does not dispel it. Time spent within an *antimagic field* counts against the suppressed spell’s duration. Summoned creatures and incorporeal undead wink out of existence if they enter an *antimagic field*. They reappear in the same spot when the field leaves the area.

### 6. Greater Dispel Magic
*   **School:** Universal [Abjuration]
*   **Level:** 6
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One spellcaster, creature, or object; or a 20-ft.-radius burst
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** This spell functions like *dispel magic*, but it can dispel multiple spells. You make one dispel check and apply that check to each ongoing spell currently in effect on the target or in the area. For each spell, if your check is successful, that spell ends. If you target a magic item, you make a dispel check; if successful, all its magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds. You can also use *greater dispel magic* to counter another spellcaster’s spell as it is being cast. In this case, your *greater dispel magic* targets the spellcaster, and you make a dispel check. If your check is equal to or higher than the DC of the spell being cast, that spell is countered.

## Level 7 Universal Spells

### 1. Chain Gate (Greater Teleport)
*   **School:** Universal [Conjuration/Teleportation]

*   **Saving Throw:** None and Will negates (object or creature)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No and Yes (object or creature)
*   **Description:** This spell functions like *teleport*, except that there is no range limit and you do not need to see the destination. You must have at least a reliable description of the place to which you are teleporting. If you attempt to teleport with insufficient information (or with misleading information), you may arrive in a location far from where you intended, or even in a hazardous one. This spell can also be used to transport a group of willing creatures, up to one additional creature per caster level. All creatures to be transported must be in contact with one another, and at least one of those creatures must be in contact with you.

### 2. Cast Echo (Spell Turning)
*   **School:** Universal [Abjuration]

*   **Duration:** 10 min./level or until discharged (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** See text
*   **Description:** Spells and spell-like abilities that target you are turned back upon the original caster. The spell affects spells of 1st through 7th level. The exact number of spell levels turned is 1d4+6. Each spell turned deducts its level from the total number of spell levels the *spell turning* can affect. For example, if you have 8 spell levels of turning and are targeted by a 3rd-level spell, that spell is turned, and you have 5 spell levels of turning left. Area effect spells are not affected. Spells that do not allow spell resistance are not turned.

### 3. Erase from Reality (Sequester)
*   **School:** Universal [Illusion]
*   **Level:** 7

*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (object) or None (willing creature)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (object)
*   **Description:** This spell makes a creature or object invisible to sight (both normal and magical) and scrying; it also cannot be detected by divination spells or clairsentience. The sequestered creature or object is effectively undetectable. For the duration, the target is also protected from all forms of harm. If cast on a creature, the creature falls into a state of suspended animation, not needing to eat, drink, or breathe, and not aging. The spell can be dispelled, or the caster can dismiss it. If the conditions for triggering a *contingency* spell occur for a sequestered creature, the *contingency* takes effect.

### 4. Meta Surge (Limited Wish)
*   **School:** Universal
*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** See text
*   **Components:** V, S, XP (300 XP)
*   **Duration:** See text
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** See text
*   **Saving Throw:** None or Will negates (see text)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes or No (see text)
*   **Description:** A *limited wish* lets you create nearly any type of effect. A *limited wish* can: duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 6th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you; duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower, provided the spell is not of a school prohibited to you; duplicate any sorcerer/wizard spell of 5th level or lower, even if it’s of a prohibited school; duplicate any other spell of 4th level or lower, even if it’s of a prohibited school; undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as *feeblemind* or *insanity*; produce any other effect whose power level is in line with the above. A *limited wish* cannot grant inherent bonuses to ability scores or grant a creature a wish. The GM has great latitude in ruling what is possible.

### 5. Phase Door
*   **School:** Universal [Conjuration/Creation]
*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Touch
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** 1 use/2 levels (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Ethereal passage through wood, plaster, or stone wall
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You create an ethereal passage through a wooden, plaster, or stone wall. The passage is invisible and intangible from the Ethereal Plane. From the Material Plane, it looks like a faint, shimmering outline of a door. You (and any creature you designate who is touching you when you cast the spell) can use the *phase door* once per two caster levels. Each use allows a creature to pass through the wall in either direction. The passage does not permit light, sound, or spell effects to pass through it. The *phase door* is subject to *dispel magic*.

### 6. Forcecage
*   **School:** Universal [Evocation/Force]
*   **Level:** 7
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action

*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** This powerful spell brings into being an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice). Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they can use teleportation or ethereal travel. The cage is not subject to damage. A *disintegrate* spell, if cast on the cage, destroys it. The cage resists dispel attempts as if its caster were 10 levels higher.

## Level 8 Universal Spells

### 1. Dimensional Break (Maze)
*   **School:** Universal [Conjuration/Teleportation]
*   **Level:** 8
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** See text (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature
*   **Saving Throw:** None (see text)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** You banish the subject to an extradimensional labyrinth of force. Each round on its turn, the subject may attempt a DC 20 Intelligence check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn’t escape, the *maze* lasts for 10 minutes, at which point the subject returns to the place it formerly occupied. If this location is occupied, the subject appears in the nearest unoccupied space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as *teleport* and *dimension door*, do not help a creature escape a *maze* spell, although a *plane shift* spell allows it to exit to the plane specified. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.

### 2. Reality Patch (Mind Blank)
*   **School:** Universal [Abjuration]
*   **Level:** 8
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** 24 hours (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One creature
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (harmless)
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes (harmless)
*   **Description:** The subject is protected from all devices and spells that detect, influence, or read emotions or thoughts. This spell protects against all mind-affecting spells and effects as well as information gathering by divination spells or effects. *Mind blank* even foils *limited wish*, *miracle*, and *wish* spells when they are used in such a way as to affect the subject’s mind or to gain information about it. In the case of scrying that scans an area the creature is in, such as *arcane eye*, the spell works but the creature simply isn’t detected. Scrying attempts that are targeted specifically at the subject do not work.

### 3. Time Echo (Temporal Acceleration)
*   **School:** Universal [Time, Transmutation]
*   **Level:** 8
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 500 gp)
*   **Duration:** 1 round/2 levels (see text) (D)
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You move and act incredibly fast. For the duration, you can take one extra standard action or move action during each of your turns. This is in addition to your regular actions. This effect does not stack with similar effects, such as the *haste* spell. When the spell ends, you are fatigued for a period equal to the time you spent under the spell’s effect.

### 4. Leyline Flow (Symbol of Death)
*   **School:** Universal [Necromancy, Conjuration]
*   **Level:** 8
*   **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
*   **Range:** 0 ft.; see text
*   **Components:** V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal, each worth a total of 5,000 gp)
*   **Duration:** See text
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One symbol
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a *symbol of death* kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The *symbol of death* affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the symbol becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 HD of creatures. A creature that succeeds on a Fortitude save is not killed, but takes 6d6 points of negative energy damage. The symbol is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; passes through a portal bearing the rune.

### 5. Prismatic Wall
*   **School:** Universal [Abjuration, Evocation]
*   **Level:** 8
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

*   **Target / Area of Effect:** Wall whose area is up to one 10-ft. square/level
*   **Saving Throw:** See text
*   **Spell Resistance:** See text
*   **Description:** You create a shimmering, multicolored wall of light that blocks sight and has different effects depending on the color struck. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. Each color in the wall has a different effect. The wall has seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Each color must be overcome separately to pass through the wall. For example, passing through the red layer deals fire damage, the orange layer deals acid damage, etc. Each layer also has additional effects, such as blindness, petrification, or insanity, often with saving throws to resist. Refer to standard D&D/Pathfinder Prismatic Wall descriptions for full layer effects.

### 6. Clone
*   **School:** Universal [Necromancy, Creation]
*   **Level:** 8
*   **Casting Time:** 1 hour
*   **Range:** 0 ft.
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of flesh from the creature to be cloned, and a specially prepared vessel worth 1,000 gp), F (a laboratory or other complex workspace)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One clone created
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** This spell makes an inert duplicate of a living creature. Should the original creature die, its soul immediately transfers to the clone, which then becomes a living being. The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same personality and memories. The clone is a new being and does not possess any of the original’s prepared spells or other limited-use abilities. The clone grows to full adulthood in 2d4 months, or you can pay an additional 50,000 gp in material components to have it mature in 2d4 days.

*   **Target / Area of Effect:** See text
*   **Saving Throw:** None

*   **Description:** You create an interdimensional connection between your plane of existence and a plane you specify, allowing travel and the calling of creatures between the two planes. The *gate* itself is a 20-foot-radius disk or hemisphere. You can use it to call a specific creature or type of creature from another plane (they are under no compulsion to obey you), or you and others can travel through it. The *gate* remains open as long as you concentrate.

### 2. Time Stop
*   **School:** Universal [Time, Transmutation]
*   **Level:** 9

*   **Target / Area of Effect:** You
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** This spell seems to make time cease to flow for everyone but you. In reality, you speed up so greatly that all other creatures seem frozen, though they are actually still moving at their normal speeds. You are free to act for 1d4+1 rounds of apparent time. Normal and magical fire, cold, gas, and so on can still harm you. While the *time stop* is in effect, other creatures are invulnerable to your attacks and spells; you cannot target or harm them. Any spell you cast with a duration that is not instantaneous expires when the *time stop* ends. You cannot move or harm creatures affected by the *time stop*, nor can you move objects held, carried, or worn by such creatures.

### 3. World Rewrite (Wish)
*   **School:** Universal
*   **Level:** 9

You may try to use a *wish* to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous, or the *wish* may only partially succeed. The GM has great latitude in ruling what is possible and the consequences of overreaching.

### 4. Planar Collapse (Implosion)
*   **School:** Universal [Evocation/Force]
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** Concentration, up to 4 rounds
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One corporeal creature/round
*   **Saving Throw:** Fortitude negates
*   **Spell Resistance:** Yes
*   **Description:** Each round you concentrate (including the first), you can choose one corporeal creature as a target and cause it to collapse in upon itself and be utterly destroyed. A creature targeted by *implosion* must make a Fortitude save. If it fails, it is slain. If it succeeds, it takes 10d6 points of damage. You can target a new creature each round as long as you maintain concentration.

### 5. Perfect Spell (Maximize Spell)
*   **School:** Universal [Metamagic]
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Free Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One spell of 8th level or lower
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** This spell allows you to cast another spell of 8th level or lower as if it were affected by the Maximize Spell feat, without increasing the spell’s actual level or casting time. All variable, numeric effects of the spell are maximized. A maximized spell deals maximum damage, cures the maximum number of hit points, affects the maximum number of targets, etc., as appropriate. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. You can only use Perfect Spell once per round.

### 6. Ritual Mastery
*   **School:** Universal
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Personal
*   **Components:** V, S, M (a page from a sacred text and incense worth 1,000 gp)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** One ritual you know
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You instantly complete any one ritual that you know and are capable of performing, provided you have all necessary material components for that ritual on hand. The ritual takes effect immediately, as if you had spent the full casting time. This spell cannot be used to perform rituals with exceptionally long casting times (typically more than 24 hours) or those requiring specific astronomical alignments or unique, unreplicable conditions, at the GM’s discretion.

### 7. Unmake Spell (Mage’s Disjunction)
*   **School:** Universal [Abjuration]
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 Standard Action
*   **Range:** Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
*   **Components:** V, S
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** All magical effects and magic items within a 30-ft.-radius burst
*   **Saving Throw:** Will negates (for magic items)
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** All magical effects and magic items within the radius of the spell, except for those on your person, are disjoined. That is, spells and spell-like effects are separated into their individual components (ending the effect as a *greater dispel magic* spell does), and each permanent magic item must make a Will save or be turned into a normal item. An item in a creature’s possession uses its own Will save bonus or its possessor’s Will save bonus, whichever is higher. If an artifact is targeted, there is a 1% chance per caster level that the *mage’s disjunction* works. If it fails, the artifact is unaffected. If it succeeds, the artifact’s functions are suppressed for 1d4 rounds.

### 8. Collapse Timeline (Genesis)
*   **School:** Universal [Conjuration/Creation, Time]
*   **Level:** 9
*   **Casting Time:** 1 week (8 hours/day)
*   **Range:** 180 ft.
*   **Components:** V, S, M (rare earths, minerals, and reagents worth 25,000 gp), XP (5,000 XP)
*   **Duration:** Instantaneous
*   **Target / Area of Effect:** A demiplane coterminous with the Ethereal Plane
*   **Saving Throw:** None
*   **Spell Resistance:** No
*   **Description:** You create a finite plane: a demiplane. This demiplane is very small, but it can be customized to your liking. The demiplane is a 180-foot cube. You determine the environment within the demiplane: its atmosphere, temperature, terrain features, and so on. The demiplane is timeless with respect to the Material Plane; once created, it does not age or change unless you use magic to alter it. You can create a permanent gate to this demiplane from a single point on the Material Plane. This spell is exceptionally taxing and requires significant resources and time.
